  abstract = {Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are proteinaceous assemblies of approximately 50 MDa that selectively transport cargoes across the nuclear envelope. To determine the molecular architecture of the yeast NPC, we collected a diverse set of biophysical and proteomic data, and developed a method for using these data to localize the NPC's 456 constituent proteins (see the accompanying paper). Our structure reveals that half of the NPC is made up of a core scaffold, which is structurally analogous to vesicle-coating complexes. This scaffold forms an interlaced network that coats the entire curved surface of the nuclear envelope membrane within which the NPC is embedded. The selective barrier for transport is formed by large numbers of proteins with disordered regions that line the inner face of the scaffold. The NPC consists of only a few structural modules that resemble each other in terms of the configuration of their homologous constituents, the most striking of these being a 16-fold repetition of 'columns'. These findings provide clues to the evolutionary origins of the NPC.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cilia are microtubule-based organelles protruding from almost all mammalian cells which, when dysfunctional, result in genetic disorders called "ciliopathies". High-throughput studies have revealed that cilia are composed of thousands of proteins. However, despite many efforts, much remains to be determined regarding the biological functions of this increasingly important complex organelle. RESULTS: We have derived an online tool, from a systematic network-based approach to dissect the cilia/centrosome complex interactome (CCCI). The tool integrates all current available data into a model which provides an "interaction" perspective on ciliary function. We generated a network of interactions between human proteins organized into functionally relevant "communities", which can be defined as groups of genes that are both highly inter-connected and strongly co-expressed. We then combined sequence and co-expression data in order to identify the transcription factors responsible for regulating genes within their respective communities. Our analyses have discovered communities significantly specialized for delegating specific biological functions such as mRNA processing, protein translation, folding and degradation processes that had never been associated with ciliary proteins until now. CONCLUSIONS: CCCI will allow us to clarify the roles of previously unknown ciliary functions, elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ciliary-associated phenotypes, and apply our knowledge of the functional roles of relatively uncharacterized molecular entities to disease phenotypes and new clinical applications.},

  abstract = {The CRISPR-associated protein Cas9 is an RNA-guided endonuclease that cleaves double-stranded DNA bearing sequences complementary to a 20-nucleotide segment in the guide RNA. Cas9 has emerged as a versatile molecular tool for genome editing and gene expression control. RNA-guided DNA recognition and cleavage strictly require the presence of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) in the target DNA. Here we report a crystal structure of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 in complex with a single-molecule guide RNA and a target DNA containing a canonical 5'-NGG-3' PAM. The structure reveals that the PAM motif resides in a base-paired DNA duplex. The non-complementary strand GG dinucleotide is read out via major-groove interactions with conserved arginine residues from the carboxy-terminal domain of Cas9. Interactions with the minor groove of the PAM duplex and the phosphodiester group at the +1 position in the target DNA strand contribute to local strand separation immediately upstream of the PAM. These observations suggest a mechanism for PAM-dependent target DNA melting and RNA-DNA hybrid formation. Furthermore, this study establishes a framework for the rational engineering of Cas9 enzymes with novel PAM specificities.},

  abstract = {Heptahelical receptors that interact with heterotrimeric G proteins represent the largest family of proteins involved in signal transduction across biological membranes. Although these receptors generally were believed to be monomeric entities, a growing body of evidence suggests that they may form functionally relevant dimers. However, a definitive demonstration of the existence of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) dimers at the surface of living cells is still lacking. Here, using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), as a protein-protein interaction assay in whole cells, we unambiguously demonstrate that the human beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR) forms constitutive homodimers when expressed in HEK-293 cells. Receptor stimulation with the hydrophilic agonist isoproterenol led to an increase in the transfer of energy between beta(2)AR molecules genetically fused to the BRET donor (Renilla luciferase) and acceptor (green fluorescent protein), respectively, indicating that the agonist interacts with receptor dimers at the cell surface. Inhibition of receptor internalization did not prevent agonist-promoted BRET, demonstrating that it did not result from clustering of receptors within endosomes. The notion that receptor dimers exist at the cell surface was confirmed further by the observation that BS3, a cell-impermeable cross-linking agent, increased BRET between beta(2)AR molecules. The selectivity of the constitutive interaction was documented by demonstrating that no BRET occurred between the beta(2)AR and two other unrelated GPCR. In contrast, the well characterized agonist-dependent interaction between the beta(2)AR and the regulatory protein beta-arrestin could be monitored by BRET. Taken together, the data demonstrate that GPCR exist as functional dimers in vivo and that BRET-based assays can be used to study both constitutive and hormone-promoted selective protein-protein interactions.},

  abstract = {Many eukaryotic green algae possess biophysical carbon-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) that enhance photosynthetic efficiency and thus permit high growth rates at low CO2 concentrations. They are thus an attractive option for improving productivity in higher plants. In this study, the intracellular locations of ten CCM components in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were confirmed. When expressed in tobacco, all of these components except chloroplastic carbonic anhydrases CAH3 and CAH6 had the same intracellular locations as in Chlamydomonas. CAH6 could be directed to the chloroplast by fusion to an Arabidopsis chloroplast transit peptide. Similarly, the putative inorganic carbon (Ci) transporter LCI1 was directed to the chloroplast from its native location on the plasma membrane. CCP1 and CCP2 proteins, putative Ci transporters previously reported to be in the chloroplast envelope, localized to mitochondria in both Chlamydomonas and tobacco, suggesting that the algal CCM model requires expansion to include a role for mitochondria. For the Ci transporters LCIA and HLA3, membrane location and Ci transport capacity were confirmed by heterologous expression and H14 CO3 - uptake assays in Xenopus oocytes. Both were expressed in Arabidopsis resulting in growth comparable with that of wild-type plants. We conclude that CCM components from Chlamydomonas can be expressed both transiently (in tobacco) and stably (in Arabidopsis) and retargeted to appropriate locations in higher plant cells. As expression of individual Ci transporters did not enhance Arabidopsis growth, stacking of further CCM components will probably be required to achieve a significant increase in photosynthetic efficiency in this species.},

We utilized the 1280 compound Sigma LOPAC annotated library to screen for phenotypes in Chlamydomonas flagellar length, motility, deflagellation, and cellular toxicity. Phenotypes were assessed by quantitation from direct microscopic visualization and custom-designed motility/viability assays. Compounds were clustered based on data across all assays to facilitate the identification of novel pathways regulating flagella in Chlamydomonas.

  abstract = {Assembly of cilia and flagella requires intraflagellar transport (IFT), a highly regulated kinesin-based transport system that moves cargo from the basal body to the tip of flagella [1]. The recruitment of IFT components to basal bodies is a function of flagellar length, with increased recruitment in rapidly growing short flagella [2]. The molecular pathways regulating IFT are largely a mystery. Because actin network disruption leads to changes in ciliary length and number, actin has been proposed to have a role in ciliary assembly. However, the mechanisms involved are unknown. In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, conventional actin is found in both the cell body and the inner dynein arm complexes within flagella [3, 4]. Previous work showed that treating Chlamydomonas cells with the actin-depolymerizing compound cytochalasin D resulted in reversible flagellar shortening [5], but how actin is related to flagellar length or assembly remains unknown. Here we utilize small-molecule inhibitors and genetic mutants to analyze the role of actin dynamics in flagellar assembly in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We demonstrate that actin plays a role in IFT recruitment to basal bodies during flagellar elongation and that when actin is perturbed, the normal dependence of IFT recruitment on flagellar length is lost. We also find that actin is required for sufficient entry of IFT material into flagella during assembly. These same effects are recapitulated with a myosin inhibitor, suggesting that actin may act via myosin in a pathway by which flagellar assembly is regulated by flagellar length.},

In contrast to the animal type rhodopsin that performs mainly sensory functions in higher eukaryotes, the bacterial type rhodopsin could function as ion channel, pumps and as sensory proteins. The functioning of rhodopsin in higher eukaryotes requires the transport of rhodopsin from its site of synthesis to the ciliated outer segment of the photoreceptive cells. However, the trafficking of bacterial type rhodopsin from its site of synthesis to the position of action is not characterized. Here we present the first report for the existence of an IFT-interactome mediated trafficking of the bacterial type rhodopsins into eyespot and flagella of the Chlamydomonas. We show that there is a light-dependent, dynamic localization of rhodopsins between flagella and eyespot of Chlamydomonas. The involvement of IFT components in the rhodopsin trafficking was elucidated by the use of conditional IFT mutants. We found that rhodopsin can be co-immunoprecipitated with the components of IFT machinery and with other protein components required for the IFT-cargo complex formation. These findings show that light-regulated localization of rhodopsin is not restricted to animals thereby suggesting that rhodopsin trafficking is an IFT dependent ancient process.},

Axonemal proteins are moved to the ciliary tip by peripheral association with the inner aspects of the ciliary membrane by cannonical ciliary IFT. At the tip, some polypeptides are released for axonemal assembly, and others are budded off as part of vesicular exosomes into the environment. It is proposed that the cilium, in addition to being a sensory and motile organelle, is also a secretory organelle.},

The protein SEC14p is essential for transport of proteins from the yeast Golgi complex. Independent characterization of the SEC14 gene and the PIT1 gene, which encodes a phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidylcholine transfer protein in yeast, indicated that these two genes are identical. Phospholipid transfer proteins are a class of cytosolic proteins that are ubiquitous among eukaryotic cells and are distinguished by their ability to catalyse the exchange of phospholipids between membranes in vitro. We show here that the SEC14 and PIT1 genes are indeed identical and that the growth phenotype of a sec14-1ts mutant extends to the inability of its transfer protein to effect phospholipid transfer in vitro. These results therefore establish for the first time an in vivo function for a phospholipid transfer protein, namely a role in the compartment-specific stimulation of protein secretion.},

In confirmation, immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated SEC14p to be an unglycosylated polypeptide, with an apparent molecular mass of some 37 kD, that behaved predominantly as a cytosolic protein in subcellular fractionation experiments. These data were consistent with the notion that SEC14p is a cytosolic factor that promotes protein export from yeast Golgi. Additional radiolabeling experiments also revealed the presence of SEC14p-related polypeptides in extracts prepared from the yeasts Kluyveromyces lactis and Schizosaccharomyces pombe.

  abstract = {The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has become an invaluable model system in plant biology. There is also considerable interest in developing this microalga into an efficient production platform for biofuels, pharmaceuticals, green chemicals and industrial enzymes. However, the production of foreign proteins in the nucleocytosolic compartment of Chlamydomonas is greatly hampered by the inefficiency of transgene expression from the nuclear genome. We have recently addressed this limitation by isolating mutant algal strains that permit high-level transgene expression and by determining the contributions of GC content and codon usage to gene expression efficiency. Here we have applied these new tools and explored the potential of Chlamydomonas to produce a recombinant biopharmaceutical, the HIV antigen P24. We show that a codon-optimized P24 gene variant introduced into our algal expression strains give rise to recombinant protein accumulation levels of up to 0.25 % of the total cellular protein. Moreover, in combination with an expression strain, a resynthesized nptII gene becomes a highly efficient selectable marker gene that facilitates the selection of transgenic algal clones at high frequency. By establishing simple principles of successful transgene expression, our data open up new possibilities for biotechnological research in Chlamydomonas.},

  abstract = {Proper functioning of cilia, hair-like structures responsible for sensation and locomotion, requires nephrocystin-5 (NPHP5) and a multi-subunit complex called the Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS)ome, but their precise relationship is not understood. The BBSome is involved in the trafficking of membrane cargos to cilia. While it is known that a loss of any single subunit prevents ciliary trafficking of the BBSome and its cargos, the mechanisms underlying ciliary entry of this complex are not well characterized. Here, we report that a transition zone protein NPHP5 contains two separate BBS-binding sites and interacts with the BBSome to mediate its integrity. Depletion of NPHP5, or expression of NPHP5 mutant missing one binding site, specifically leads to dissociation of BBS2 and BBS5 from the BBSome and loss of ciliary BBS2 and BBS5 without compromising the ability of the other subunits to traffic into cilia. Depletion of Cep290, another transition zone protein that directly binds to NPHP5, causes additional dissociation of BBS8 and loss of ciliary BBS8. Furthermore, delivery of BBSome cargos, smoothened, VPAC2 and Rab8a, to the ciliary compartment is completely disabled in the absence of single BBS subunits, but is selectively impaired in the absence of NPHP5 or Cep290. These findings define a new role of NPHP5 and Cep290 in controlling integrity and ciliary trafficking of the BBSome, which in turn impinge on the delivery of ciliary cargo.},

  abstract = {The Escherichia coli biotin holoenzyme synthetase, BirA, catalyzes transfer of biotin to the epsilon amino group of a specific lysine residue of the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) subunit of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Sequences of naturally biotinylated substrates are highly conserved across evolutionary boundaries, and cross-species biotinylation has been demonstrated in several systems. To define the minimal substrate requirements in BirA-catalyzed biotinylation, we have measured the kinetics of modification of a 23-residue peptide previously identified by combinatorial methods. Although the sequence of the peptide bears little resemblance to the biotinylated sequence in BCCP, it is enzymatically biotinylated in vivo. Rates of biotin transfer to the 23-residue peptide are similar to those determined for BCCP. To further elucidate the sequence requirements for biotinylation, transient kinetic measurements were performed on a series of amino- and carboxy-terminal truncations of the 23-mer. The results, determined by stopped-flow fluorescence, allowed identification of a 14-residue peptide as the minimum required sequence. Additional support was obtained using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometric analysis of peptides that had been incubated with an excess of biotinyl-5'-adenylate intermediate and catalytic amounts of BirA. Results of these measurements indicate that while kinetically inactive truncations showed no significant shift in molecular mass to the values expected for biotinylated species, kinetically active truncations exhibited 100% biotinylation. The specificity constant (k(cat)/Km) governing BirA-catalyzed biotinylation of the 14-mer minimal substrate is similar to that determined for the natural substrate, BCCP. We conclude that the 14-mer peptide efficiently mimics the biotin acceptor function of the much larger protein domain normally recognized by BirA.},

To better understand the architecture of these two complexes, a multifaceted approach has been employed to identify subcomplexes and specific protein-protein interactions. The high biochemical yields afforded with Chlamydomonas preparations have allowed traditional biochemical approaches including chemical cross-linking and disruption of native complexes, which, in the case of IFT B, have revealed a core subcomplex retaining nine of the B subunits. Complementing these results are molecular approaches including two-hybrid screenings and heterologous expression that have identified specific protein-protein interactions. Lastly, genetic approaches utilizing Chlamydomonas IFT mutants have shown how the loss of specific subunits perturb the complexes and, in the case of IFT A, they have revealed a core subcomplex containing half of the A subunits.},

We provide here the proteomic and immunological analyses that verify the identity of all six Chlamydomonas A proteins. Using sucrose density gradient centrifugation and antibody pulldowns, we show that all six A subunits are associated in a 16 S complex in both the cell bodies and flagella. A significant fraction of the cell body IFT43, however, exhibits a much slower sedimentation of approximately 2 S and is not associated with the IFT A complex. To identify interactions between the six A proteins, we combined exhaustive yeast-based two-hybrid analysis, heterologous recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli, and analysis of the newly identified complex A mutants, ift121 and ift122. We show that IFT121 and IFT43 interact directly and provide evidence for additional interactions between IFT121 and IFT139, IFT121 and IFT122, IFT140 and IFT122, and IFT140 and IFT144. The mutant analysis further allows us to propose that a subset of complex A proteins, IFT144/140/122, can form a stable 12 S subcomplex that we refer to as the IFT A core. Based on these results, we propose a model for the spatial arrangement of the six IFT A components.},

  abstract = {The membrane protein composition of the primary cilium, a key sensory organelle, is dynamically regulated during cilium-generated signaling [1, 2]. During ciliogenesis, ciliary membrane proteins, along with structural and signaling proteins, are carried through the multicomponent, intensely studied ciliary diffusion barrier at the base of the organelle [3-8] by intraflagellar transport (IFT) [9-18]. A favored model is that signaling-triggered accumulation of previously excluded membrane proteins in fully formed cilia [19-21] also requires IFT, but direct evidence is lacking. Here, in studies of regulated entry of a membrane protein into the flagellum of Chlamydomonas, we show that cells use an IFT-independent mechanism to breach the diffusion barrier at the flagellar base. In resting cells, a flagellar signaling component [22], the integral membrane polypeptide SAG1-C65, is uniformly distributed over the plasma membrane and excluded from the flagellar membrane. Flagellar adhesion-induced signaling triggers rapid, striking redistribution of the protein to the apical ends of the cells concomitantly with entry into the flagella. Protein polarization and flagellar enrichment are facilitated by cytoplasmic microtubules. Using a conditional anterograde IFT mutant, we demonstrate that the IFT machinery is not required for regulated SAG1-C65 entry into flagella. Thus, integral membrane proteins can negotiate passage through the ciliary diffusion barrier without the need for a motor.},

Recent studies have focused on a specific membrane domain found at the base of primary cilia in most cell types which was already mentioned in the first descriptions of these cilia but did not raise much interest during 50 years. This membrane domain, the 'ciliary pocket', also found at the base of some motile cilia, may act as a platform for cilia-associated vesicular trafficking and as an interface with the actin cytoskeleton but also likely in additional important functions which remain to be discovered.},

  abstract = {Primary cilia are sensory organelles present on most mammalian cells. The functions of cilia are defined by the signaling proteins localized to the ciliary membrane. Certain G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including somatostatin receptor 3 (Sstr3) and serotonin receptor 6 (Htr6), localize to cilia. As Sstr3 and Htr6 are the only somatostatin and serotonin receptor subtypes that localize to cilia, we hypothesized they contain ciliary localization sequences. To test this hypothesis we expressed chimeric receptors containing fragments of Sstr3 and Htr6 in the nonciliary receptors Sstr5 and Htr7, respectively, in ciliated cells. We found the third intracellular loop of Sstr3 or Htr6 is sufficient for ciliary localization. Comparison of these loops revealed a loose consensus sequence. To determine whether this consensus sequence predicts ciliary localization of other GPCRs, we compared it with the third intracellular loop of all human GPCRs. We identified the consensus sequence in melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (Mchr1) and confirmed Mchr1 localizes to primary cilia in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we have identified a putative GPCR ciliary localization sequence and used this sequence to identify a novel ciliary GPCR. As Mchr1 mediates feeding behavior and metabolism, our results implicate ciliary signaling in the regulation of body weight.},

Here, we investigated the uncharacterized process of primary ciliogenesis in polarized epithelial cells. We show that after cytokinesis, the midbody is inherited by one of the daughter cells as a remnant that initially locates peripherally at the apical surface of one of the daughter cells. The remnant then moves along the apical surface and, once proximal to the centrosome at the center of the apical surface, enables cilium formation. The physical removal of the remnant greatly impairs ciliogenesis. We developed a probabilistic cell population-based model that reproduces the experimental data. In addition, our model explains, solely in terms of cell area constraints, the various observed transitions of the midbody, the beginning of ciliogenesis, and the accumulation of ciliated cells. Our findings reveal a biological mechanism that links the three microtubule-based organelles-the midbody, the centrosome, and the cilium-in the same cellular process.},

  abstract = {In BRET2 (Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer), a Renilla luciferase (RLuc) is used as the donor protein, while a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP2) is used as the acceptor protein. In the presence of the cell permeable substrate DeepBlueC, RLuc emits blue light at 395 nm. If the GFP2 is brought into close proximity to RLuc via a specific biomolecular interaction, the GFP2 will absorb the blue light energy and reemit green light at 510nm. BRET2 signals are therefore easily determined by measuring the ratio of green over blue light (510/395nm) using appropriate dual channel luminometry instruments (e.g., Fusion Universal Microplate Analyzer, Packard BioScience). Since no light source is required for BRET2 assays, the technology does not suffer from high fluorescent background or photobleaching, the common problems associated with standard FRET-based assays. Using BRET2, we developed a generic G Protein-Coupled Receptor (GPCR) assay based on the observation that activation of the majority of GPCRs by agonists leads to the interaction of beta-arrestin (a protein that is involved in receptor desensitization and sequestration) with the receptor. We established a cell line stably expressing the GFP2:beta-arrestin 2 fusion protein, and showed that it can be used to monitor the activation of various transiently expressed GPCRs, in BRET2/arrestin assays. In addition, using the HEK 293/GFP2:beta-arrestin 2 cell line as a recipient, we generated a double-stable line co-expressing the vasopressin 2 receptor (V2R) fused to RLuc (V2R:RLuc) and used it for the pharmacological characterization of compounds in BRET2/arrestin assays. This approach yields genuine pharmacology and supports the BRET2/arrestin assay as a tool that can be used with recombinant cell lines to characterize ligand-GPCR interactions which can be applied to ligand identification for orphan receptors.},

We demonstrate the applicability and versatility of AQUA Cloning in selected proof-of-principle applications including targeted insertion-, deletion- and site-directed point-mutagenesis, and combinatorial cloning. Furthermore, we show the one pot de novo assembly of multiple DNA fragments into a single circular plasmid encoding a complex light- and chemically-regulated Boolean A NIMPLY B logic operation. AQUA Cloning harnesses intrinsic in vivo processing of linear DNA fragments with short regions of homology of 16 to 32 bp mediated by Escherichia coli. It does not require any kits, enzymes or preparations of reagents and is the simplest assembly cloning protocol to date.},

GDIV1p was localized in the cytoplasm and in the algal flagellum.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Conorenal syndrome is a systemic skeletal ciliopathy characterised by skeletal and renal findings and caused by biallelic mutations in the gene intraflagellar transport 140 Chlamydomonas homologue (IFT140). Most studies have focused on syndromic features and are by non-ophthalmologists. We highlight the ophthalmic phenotype. METHODS: Retrospective consecutive case series (2010-2014). RESULTS: Twelve subjects with confirmed homozygous mutations were identified (11 consanguineous families; 7 boys; assessed at age 10 months to 20 years, average and median age 6.5 and 4 years). All were homozygous for the same IFT140 mutation (c.1990G>A; p.Glu664Lys) except one who was homozygous for c.1541_1542delinsAA. All had poor vision and nystagmus since birth, with visual acuity after 5 years old of hand motions or light perception. In early childhood, nine were noted to stare at lights, four were noted to have a happy demeanour, high hyperopia was typical, and electroretinography was non-recordable. Fundus appearance was grossly normal before the age of 1 year but thereafter appeared dystrophic. Eight children had developmental delay, two had short stubby fingers, and one had renal disease, but four had no evident extraocular disease, including one aged 18 years who also had two older affected siblings in their twenties who remained non-syndromic and were excelling academically. CONCLUSIONS: Recessive IFT140 mutations cause a severe congenital retinal dystrophy with high hyperopia and often early photophilia. Developmental delay is common but not universal and not all patients have obvious extraocular findings. The c.1990G>A mutation represents a founder effect or mutational hotspot on the Arabian Peninsula.},

Although primary cilia have been detected throughout the mammalian brain, their functions are unknown. The study of primary cilia in the brain is constrained by the scarcity of specific markers for these organelles. We previously demonstrated that type III adenylyl cyclase (ACIII) is a marker for primary cilia on neonatal hippocampal neurons in vivo and in vitro. We further showed that ACIII localizes to cilia on cultured glial cells. Here, we report that ACIII is a marker for primary cilia throughout many regions of the adult mouse brain. Furthermore, we report that ACIII localizes to primary cilia on choroid plexus cells and some astrocytes in the brain, which to our knowledge is the first report of a marker for visualizing cilia on glia in vivo. Overall, our data indicate that ACIII is a prominent marker of primary cilia in the brain and will provide an important tool to facilitate further investigations into the functions of these organelles.},

Here we identified mutations in TRAF3IP1 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor Interacting Protein 1) in eight patients from five families with nephronophthisis (NPH) and retinal degeneration, two of the most common manifestations of ciliopathies. TRAF3IP1 encodes IFT54, a subunit of the IFT-B complex required for ciliogenesis. The identified mutations result in mild ciliary defects in patients but also reveal an unexpected role of IFT54 as a negative regulator of microtubule stability via MAP4 (microtubule-associated protein 4). Microtubule defects are associated with altered epithelialization/polarity in renal cells and with pronephric cysts and microphthalmia in zebrafish embryos. Our findings highlight the regulation of cytoplasmic microtubule dynamics as a role of the IFT54 protein beyond the cilium, contributing to the development of NPH-related ciliopathies.},

  abstract = {Cellular organelles provide opportunities to relate biological mechanisms to disease. Here we use affinity proteomics, genetics and cell biology to interrogate cilia: poorly understood organelles, where defects cause genetic diseases. Two hundred and seventeen tagged human ciliary proteins create a final landscape of 1,319 proteins, 4,905 interactions and 52 complexes. Reverse tagging, repetition of purifications and statistical analyses, produce a high-resolution network that reveals organelle-specific interactions and complexes not apparent in larger studies, and links vesicle transport, the cytoskeleton, signalling and ubiquitination to ciliary signalling and proteostasis. We observe sub-complexes in exocyst and intraflagellar transport complexes, which we validate biochemically, and by probing structurally predicted, disruptive, genetic variants from ciliary disease patients. The landscape suggests other genetic diseases could be ciliary including 3M syndrome. We show that 3M genes are involved in ciliogenesis, and that patient fibroblasts lack cilia. Overall, this organelle-specific targeting strategy shows considerable promise for Systems Medicine.},

  abstract = {Cilia are microtubule-based projections that serve a wide variety of essential functions in animal cells. Defects in cilia structure or function have recently been found to underlie diverse human diseases. While many eukaryotic cells possess only one or two cilia, some cells, including those of many unicellular organisms, exhibit many cilia. In vertebrates, multiciliated cells are a specialized population of post-mitotic cells decorated with dozens of motile cilia that beat in a polarized and synchronized fashion to drive directed fluid flow across an epithelium. Dysfunction of human multiciliated cells is associated with diseases of the brain, airway and reproductive tracts. Despite their importance, multiciliated cells are relatively poorly studied and we are only beginning to understand the mechanisms underlying their development and function. Here, we review the general phylogeny and physiology of multiciliation and detail our current understanding of the developmental and cellular events underlying the specification, differentiation and function of multiciliated cells in vertebrates.},

  abstract = {Intraflagellar transport (IFT) moves IFT trains carrying cargoes from the cell body into the flagellum and from the flagellum back to the cell body. IFT trains are composed of complexes IFT-A and IFT-B and cargo adaptors such as the BBSome. The IFT-B core proteins IFT74 and IFT81 interact directly through central and C-terminal coiled-coil domains, and recently it was shown that the N termini of these proteins form a tubulin-binding module important for ciliogenesis. To investigate the function of IFT74 and its domains in vivo, we have utilized Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ift74 mutants. In a null mutant, lack of IFT74 destabilized IFT-B, leading to flagella assembly failure. In this null background, expression of IFT74 lacking 130 amino acids (aa) of the charged N terminus stabilized IFT-B and promoted slow assembly of nearly full-length flagella. A further truncation (lacking aa 1-196, including part of coiled-coil 1) also stabilized IFT-B, but failure in IFT-A/IFT-B interaction within the pool at the base of the flagellum prevented entry of IFT-A into the flagellum and led to severely decreased IFT injection frequency and flagellar-assembly defects. Decreased IFT-A in these short flagella resulted in aggregates of stalled IFT-B in the flagella. We conclude that IFT74 is required to stabilize IFT-B; aa 197-641 are sufficient for this function in vivo. The N terminus of IFT74 may be involved in, but is not required for, tubulin entry into flagella. It is required for association of IFT-A and IFT-B at the base of the flagellum and flagellar import of IFT-A.},

Mice lacking the basal body component Chibby (Cby) exhibit impaired mucociliary transport caused by defective ciliogenesis, resulting in chronic airway infection. In this paper, using primary cultures of mouse tracheal epithelial cells, we show that Cby facilitates basal body docking to the apical cell membrane through proper formation of ciliary vesicles at the distal appendage during the early stages of ciliogenesis. Cby is recruited to the distal appendages of centrioles via physical interaction with the distal appendage protein CEP164. Cby then associates with the membrane trafficking machinery component Rabin8, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small guanosine triphosphatase Rab8, to promote recruitment of Rab8 and efficient assembly of ciliary vesicles. Thus, our study identifies Cby as a key regulator of ciliary vesicle formation and basal body docking during the differentiation of airway ciliated cells.},

  abstract = {Planar cell polarity (PCP) is a ubiquitous property of animal tissues and is essential for morphogenesis and homeostasis. In most cases, this fundamental property is governed by a deeply conserved set of “Core PCP” proteins, which includes the transmembrane proteins Van Gogh-like (Vangl) and Frizzled (Fzd), as well as the cytoplasmic effectors Prickle (Pk) and Dishevelled (Dvl). Asymmetric localization of these proteins is thought to be central to their function, and understanding the dynamics of these proteins is an important challenge in developmental biology. Among the processes that are organized by the core PCP proteins is the directional beating of cilia, such as those in vertebrate node, airway and brain. Here, we exploit the live imaging capabilities of Xenopus to chart the progressive asymmetric localization of fluorescent reporters of Dvl1, Pk2 and Vangl1 in a planar polarized ciliated epithelium. Using this system, we also characterize the influence of Pk2 on asymmetric dynamics of Vangl1 at the cell cortex, and we define regions of Pk2 that control its own localization and those impacting Vangl1. Finally, our data reveal a striking uncoupling of Vangl1 and Dvl1 asymmetry. This study advances our understanding of conserved PCP protein functions and also establishes a rapid, tractable platform to facilitate future in vivo studies of vertebrate PCP protein dynamics.},

  abstract = {Primary cilia play critical roles in development and disease. Their assembly is triggered by mature centrioles (basal bodies) and requires centrosomal protein 164kDa (Cep164), a component of distal appendages. Here we show that loss of Cep164 leads to early defects in ciliogenesis, reminiscent of the phenotypic consequences of mutations in TTBK2 (Tau tubulin kinase 2). We identify Cep164 as a likely physiological substrate of TTBK2 and demonstrate that Cep164 and TTBK2 form a complex. We map the interaction domains and demonstrate that complex formation is crucial for the recruitment of TTBK2 to basal bodies. Remarkably, ciliogenesis can be restored in Cep164-depleted cells by expression of chimeric proteins in which TTBK2 is fused to the C-terminal centriole-targeting domain of Cep164. These findings indicate that one of the major functions of Cep164 in ciliogenesis is to recruit active TTBK2 to centrioles. Once positioned, TTBK2 then triggers key events required for ciliogenesis, including removal of CP110 and recruitment of intraflagellar transport proteins. In addition, our data suggest that TTBK2 also acts upstream of Cep164, contributing to the assembly of distal appendages.},

  abstract = {Transport of proteins to and from cilia is crucial for normal cell function and survival, and interruption of transport has been implicated in degenerative and neoplastic diseases. It has been hypothesized that the ciliary axoneme and structures adjacent to and including the basal bodies of cilia impose selective barriers to the movement of proteins into and out of the cilium. To examine this hypothesis, using confocal and multiphoton microscopy we determined the mobility of the highly soluble photoactivatable green fluorescent protein (PAGFP) in the connecting cilium (CC) of live Xenopus retinal rod photoreceptors, and in the contiguous subcellular compartments bridged by the CC, the inner segment (IS) and the outer segment (OS). The estimated axial diffusion coefficients are D(CC) = 2.8 +/- 0.3, D(IS) = 5.2 +/- 0.6, and D(OS) = 0.079 +/- 0.009 microm(2) s(-1). The results establish that the CC does not pose a major barrier to protein diffusion within the rod cell. However, the results also reveal that axial diffusion in each of the rod's compartments is substantially retarded relative to aqueous solution: the axial diffusion of PAGFP was retarded approximately 18-, 32- and 1,000-fold in the IS, CC, and OS, respectively, with approximately 20-fold of the reduction in the OS attributable to tortuosity imposed by the lamellar disc membranes. Previous investigation of PAGFP diffusion in passed, spherical Chinese hamster ovary cells yielded D(CHO) = 20 microm(2) s(-1), and estimating cytoplasmic viscosity as D(aq)/D(CHO) = 4.5, the residual 3- to 10-fold reduction in PAGFP diffusion is ascribed to sub-optical resolution structures in the IS, CC, and OS compartments.},

Recently, we showed that cilium-generated signaling in Chlamydomonas induced rapid, anterograde IFT-independent, cytoplasmic microtubule-dependent redistribution of the membrane polypeptide, SAG1-C65, from the plasma membrane to the periciliary region and the ciliary membrane. Here, we report that the retrograde IFT motor, cytoplasmic dynein 1b, is required in the cytoplasm for this rapid redistribution. Furthermore, signaling-induced trafficking of SAG1-C65 into cilia is unidirectional and the entire complement of cellular SAG1-C65 is shed during signaling and can be recovered in the form of ciliary ectosomes that retain signal-inducing activity. Thus, during signaling, cells regulate ciliary membrane protein composition through cytoplasmic action of the retrograde IFT motor and shedding of ciliary ectosomes.},

In multicellular eukaryotes, the core components of RNA-mediated silencing have significantly expanded and diversified, resulting in partly distinct pathways for the epigenetic control of gene expression and genomic parasites. In contrast, many unicellular organisms with small nuclear genomes seem to have lost entirely the RNA-silencing machinery or have retained only a basic set of components. We report here that Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a unicellular eukaryote with a relatively large nuclear genome, has undergone extensive duplication of Dicer and Argonaute polypeptides after the divergence of the green algae and land plant lineages. Chlamydomonas encodes three Dicers and three Argonautes with DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1) and ARGONAUTE1 being more divergent than the other paralogs. Interestingly, DCL1 is uniquely involved in the post-transcriptional silencing of retrotransposons such as TOC1. Moreover, on the basis of the subcellular distribution of TOC1 small RNAs and target transcripts, this pathway most likely operates in the nucleus. However, Chlamydomonas also relies on a DCL1-independent, transcriptional silencing mechanism(s) for the maintenance of transposon repression. Our results suggest that multiple, partly redundant epigenetic processes are involved in preventing transposon mobilization in this green alga.},

  abstract = {Site-specific genome engineering technologies are increasingly important tools in the postgenomic era, where biotechnological objectives often require organisms with precisely modified genomes. Rare-cutting endonucleases, through their capacity to create a targeted DNA strand break, are one of the most promising of these technologies. However, realizing the full potential of nuclease-induced genome engineering requires a detailed understanding of the variables that influence resolution of nuclease-induced DNA breaks. Here we present a genome engineering reporter system, designated 'traffic light', that supports rapid flow-cytometric analysis of repair pathway choice at individual DNA breaks, quantitative tracking of nuclease expression and donor template delivery, and high-throughput screens for factors that bias the engineering outcome. We applied the traffic light system to evaluate the efficiency and outcome of nuclease-induced genome engineering in human cell lines and identified strategies to facilitate isolation of cells in which a desired engineering outcome has occurred.},

In transformants of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, expression of a eubacterial aadA gene, conferring spectinomycin resistance, is transcriptionally suppressed by a reversible epigenetic mechanism(s). Variations in the size and frequency of colonies surviving on different concentrations of spectinomycin as well as the levels of transcriptional activity of the introduced transgene(s) suggest the existence of intermediate expression states in genetically identical cells. Gene silencing does not correlate with methylation of the integrated DNA and does not involve large alterations in its chromatin structure, as revealed by digestion with restriction endonucleases and DNase I. Transgene repression is enhanced by lower temperatures, similar to position effect variegation in Drosophila. By analogy to epigenetic phenomena in several eukaryotes, our results suggest a possible role for (hetero)chromatic chromosomal domains in transcriptional inactivation.},

  abstract = {We have constructed a dominant selectable marker for nuclear transformation of C. reinhardtii, composed of the coding sequence of the eubacterial aadA gene (conferring spectinomycin resistance) fused to the 5' and 3' untranslated regions of the endogenous RbcS2 gene. Spectinomycin-resistant transformants isolated by direct selection (1) contain the chimeric gene(s) stably integrated into the nuclear genome, (2) show cosegregation of the resistance phenotype with the introduced DNA, and (3) synthesize the expected mRNA and protein. Small linearized plasmids appeared to be inserted into the nuclear genome preferentially through their ends, with relatively few large deletions and/or rearrangements. Multiple copy transformants often integrated concatemers of transforming DNA. Our detailed analysis of the complex integration patterns of plasmid DNA in C. reinhardtii nuclear transformants should be useful for improving the technique of insertional mutagenesis. We also found that the spectinomycin-resistance phenotype was unstable in about half of the transformants. When maintained under nonselective conditions, neither the aadA mRNA nor the AadA protein were detected in these subclones. Moreover, since the integrated transforming DNA was not altered or lost expression of the RbcS2::aadA::RbcS2 gene(s) appears to be repressed. Measurements of transcriptional activity, mRNA accumulation, and mRNA stability suggest that expression of this chimeric gene(s) may also be affected by rapid RNA degradation, presumably due to defects in mRNA processing and, or nuclear export. Thus, both gene silencing and transcript instability, rather than biased codon usage, may explain the difficulties encountered in the expression of foreign genes in the nuclear genome of Chlamydomonas.},

  abstract = {Genome engineering with programmable nucleases depends on cellular responses to a targeted double-strand break (DSB). The first truly targetable reagents were the zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) showing that arbitrary DNA sequences could be addressed for cleavage by protein engineering, ushering in the breakthrough in genome manipulation. ZFNs resulted from basic research on zinc finger proteins and the FokI restriction enzyme (which revealed a bipartite structure with a separable DNA-binding domain and a non-specific cleavage domain). Studies on the mechanism of cleavage by 3-finger ZFNs established that the preferred substrates were paired binding sites, which doubled the size of the target sequence recognition from 9 to 18bp, long enough to specify a unique genomic locus in plant and mammalian cells. Soon afterwards, a ZFN-induced DSB was shown to stimulate homologous recombination in cells. Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) that are based on bacterial TALEs fused to the FokI cleavage domain expanded this capability. The fact that ZFNs and TALENs have been used for genome modification of more than 40 different organisms and cell types attests to the success of protein engineering. The most recent technology platform for delivering a targeted DSB to cellular genomes is that of the RNA-guided nucleases, which are based on the naturally occurring Type II prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas9 system. Unlike ZFNs and TALENs that use protein motifs for DNA sequence recognition, CRISPR-Cas9 depends on RNA-DNA recognition. The advantages of the CRISPR-Cas9 system-the ease of RNA design for new targets and the dependence on a single, constant Cas9 protein-have led to its wide adoption by research laboratories around the world. These technology platforms have equipped scientists with an unprecedented ability to modify cells and organisms almost at will, with wide-ranging implications across biology and medicine. However, these nucleases have also been shown to cut at off-target sites with mutagenic consequences. Therefore, issues such as efficacy, specificity and delivery are likely to drive selection of reagents for particular purposes. Human therapeutic applications of these technologies will ultimately depend on risk versus benefit analysis and informed consent.},

Mutations in inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase E (INPP5E) have been associated with ciliary dysfunction; however, its role in regulating ciliary phosphoinositides is unknown. Here we report that in neural stem cells, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) is found in high levels in cilia whereas phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) is not detectable. Upon INPP5E inactivation, PI(4,5)P2 accumulates at the ciliary tip whereas PI4P is depleted. This is accompanied by recruitment of the PI(4,5)P2-interacting protein TULP3 to the ciliary membrane, along with Gpr161. This results in an increased production of cAMP and a repression of the Shh transcription gene Gli1. Our results reveal the link between ciliary regulation of phosphoinositides by INPP5E and Shh regulation via ciliary trafficking of TULP3/Gpr161 and also provide mechanistic insight into ciliary alterations found in Joubert and MORM syndromes resulting from INPP5E mutations.},

  abstract = {It is known that Fas death domain-associated protein (Daxx) possesses both putative nuclear and cytoplasmic functions. However, the nuclear transport mechanism is largely unknown. This study examined the nuclear location signal (NLS) of Daxx and whether the nuclear transport of Daxx was mediated by small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO). Two NLS motifs of Daxx, leucine (L)-rich nuclear export signal (NES)-like motif (188IXXLXXLLXL197) and C-terminal lysine (K) rich NLS2 (amino acids 627-634) motif, were identified and the K630 and K631 on the NLS2 motif were characterized as the major sumoylation sites of Daxx by in vitro sumoylation analysis. Proteins of inactive SUMO (SUMO-delta), a sumoylation-incompetent mutant, and Daxx NLS mutants (Daxx-NES(mut) and Daxx NLS2(mut)) were dispersed in cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic dispersed Daxx mutants could be relocalized to nucleus by cotransfection with active SUMO, but not with inactive SUMO-delta, demonstrating the role of SUMO on regulating the cytoplasmonuclear transport of Daxx. However, inactive SUMO-delta could also be relocalized to nucleus during cotransfection with wild-type Daxx, suggesting that SUMO regulation of the cytoplasmonuclear transport of its target protein Daxx does not need covalent modification. This study shows that cytoplasmic SUMO has a biological role in enhancing the cytoplasmonuclear transport of its target protein Daxx and it may be done through the non-sumoylation interactions.},

Because ketones are absent from native cell surfaces, AP-fused recombinant cell surface proteins can be tagged with the ketone probe and then specifically conjugated to hydrazide- or hydroxylamine-functionalized molecules. We demonstrate this two-stage protein labeling methodology on purified protein, in the context of mammalian cell lysate, and on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expressed on the surface of live HeLa cells. Both fluorescein and a benzophenone photoaffinity probe are incorporated, with total labeling times as short as 20 min.},

However, their function as ion channels at the plasma membrane does not totally explain their crucial role in tumors.

In this study we investigated the localization and possible roles of perinuclear K(V)10.1. We show that K(V)10.1 is expressed at the inner nuclear membrane in both human and rat models; it co-purifies with established inner nuclear membrane markers, shows resistance to detergent extraction and restricted mobility, all of them typical features of proteins at the inner nuclear membrane. K(V)10.1 channels at the inner nuclear membrane are not all transported directly from the ER but rather have been exposed to the extracellular milieu. Patch clamp experiments on nuclei devoid of external nuclear membrane reveal the existence of channel activity compatible with K(V)10.1. We hypothesize that K(V)10.1 channels at the nuclear envelope might participate in the homeostasis of nuclear K(+), or indirectly interact with heterochromatin, both factors known to affect gene expression.},

The mutant BirA also self biotinylates in vivo and in vitro. The wild type BirA protein is much less active in these reactions. The biotinylation reaction is proximity-dependent in that a greater extent of biotinylation was seen when the mutant ligase was coupled to the acceptor proteins than when the acceptors were free in solution. This approach may permit facile detection and recovery of interacting proteins by existing avidin/streptavidin technology.},

  abstract = {Intraflagellar transport (IFT) underpins many of the important cellular roles of cilia and flagella in signaling and motility. The microtubule motors kinesin-2 and cytoplasmic dynein 1b drive IFT particles (protein complexes carrying ciliary component proteins) along the axoneme to facilitate the assembly and maintenance of cilia. IFT is regulated primarily by cargo loading onto the IFT particles, although evidence suggests that IFT particles also exhibit differential rates of movement. Here we demonstrate that intraflagellar Ca(2+) elevations act to directly regulate the movement of IFT particles. IFT-driven movement of adherent flagella membrane glycoproteins in the model alga Chlamydomonas enables flagella-mediated gliding motility. We find that surface contact promotes the localized accumulation of IFT particles in Chlamydomonas flagella. Highly compartmentalized intraflagellar Ca(2+) elevations initiate retrograde transport of paused IFT particles to modulate their accumulation. Gliding motility induces mechanosensitive intraflagellar Ca(2+) elevations in trailing (dragging) flagella only, acting to specifically clear the accumulated microtubule motors from individual flagella and prevent a futile tug-of-war. Our results demonstrate that compartmentalized intraciliary Ca(2+) signaling can regulate the movement of IFT particles and is therefore likely to play a central role in directing the movement and distribution of many ciliary proteins.},

Our knowledge of this network keeps growing due to the development of sensitive techniques devoted to study these interactions. The bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) technique was primarily developed to allow the dynamic monitoring of protein/protein interactions (PPI) in living cells, and has widely been used to study receptor activation by intra- or extra-molecular conformational changes within receptors and activated complexes in mammal cells. Some interactions are described as crucial in human pathological processes, and a new class of drugs targeting them has recently emerged. The BRET method is well suited to identify inhibitors of PPI and here is described why and how to set up and optimize a high throughput screening assay based on BRET to search for such inhibitory compounds. The different parameters to take into account when developing such BRET assays in mammal cells are reviewed to give general guidelines: considerations on the targeted interaction, choice of BRET version, inducibility of the interaction, kinetic of the monitored interaction, and of the BRET reading, influence of substrate concentration, number of cells and medium composition used on the Z' factor, and expected interferences from colored or fluorescent compounds.},

  abstract = {The assembly of the axoneme, the structural scaffold of cilia and flagella, requires translocation of a vast quantity of tubulin into the growing cilium, but the mechanisms that regulate the targeting, quantity, and timing of tubulin transport are largely unknown. In Chlamydomonas, GFP-tagged alpha-tubulin enters cilia as an intraflagellar transport (IFT) cargo and by diffusion. IFT-based transport of GFP-tubulin is elevated in growing cilia and IFT trains carry more tubulin. Cells possessing both nongrowing and growing cilia selectively target GFP-tubulin into the latter. The preferential delivery of tubulin boosts the concentration of soluble tubulin in the matrix of growing versus steady-state cilia. Cilia length mutants show abnormal kinetics of tubulin transport. We propose that cells regulate the extent of occupancy of IFT trains by tubulin cargoes. During ciliary growth, IFT concentrates soluble tubulin in cilia and thereby promotes elongation of the axonemal microtubules.},

  abstract = {Post-translational modification of proteins with biotin provides the means to specifically label proteins in vivo and to purify proteins from crude cell lysates. The carboxyl-terminal protein segments modified by reaction with biotin ligase are strongly conserved in nature. We have demonstrated that the proteins encoded by translational gene fusions of a number of heterologous proteins to these carboxyl-terminal sequences become biotinated in vivo. The minimum size of the protein segment needed to allow biotination of fusion proteins is 75 amino acids. This biotination sequence, although of bacterial origin, functions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as in Escherichia coli. Fusion proteins are readily labeled with [3H]biotin in vivo and the labeling is highly specific due to the scarcity (less than 5) of biotinated protein species. Biotinated fusion proteins can be readily purified in native form by binding to columns of monomeric avidin followed by elution with buffers containing biotin. Alternatively, proteins can be purified in a denatured form in presence of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate or 8 M urea. Thus, this technology allows purification by affinity chromatography of any protein to which a biotination sequence can be attached. The ability to specifically label a protein in vivo should have utility in studies such as intracellular protein trafficking and cytoskeletonal dynamics.},

  abstract = {In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, transcripts from the beta 2-tubulin gene (tubB2), as well as those from other tubulin-encoding genes, accumulate immediately after flagellar excision as well as at a specific time in the cell cycle. Control of tubB2 transcript accumulation following deflagellation is regulated, at least partially, at the transcriptional level. We have fused the tubB2 promoter to the arylsulfatase (ars) reporter gene, introduced this construct into C. reinhardtii, and compared expression of the chimeric gene with that of the endogenous tubB2 gene. After flagellar excision, transcripts from the tubB2/ars chimeric gene accumulate with kinetics similar to those of transcripts from the endogenous tubB2 gene. The tubB2/ars transcripts also accumulate in a cell cycle-specific manner; however, chimeric transcripts are more abundant earlier in the cell cycle than the endogenous tubB2 transcripts. To elucidate transcriptional control of tubB2, we have mutated or removed sequences in the tubB2 promoter and examined the effect on transcription. The tubB2 promoter shares features with the promoters of other tubulin-encoding genes; these include a GC-rich region between the TATA box and the transcription initiation site and multiple copies of a 10-bp sequence motif that we call the tub box. The tubB2 gene contains seven tub box motifs. Changing the GC-rich region to an AT-rich region or removing three of the seven tub box motifs did not significantly affect transcription of the chimeric gene. However, removing four or five tub box motifs prevented increased transcription following deflagellation and diminished cell cycle-regulated transcription from the tubB2 promoter.},

Outer dynein arms (ODAs) require assembly factors to assist their preassembly, transport and attachment to cargo (specific doublet A-tubule sites). In Chlamydomonas, three assembly factors, ODA5, ODA8 and ODA10, show genetic interactions and have been proposed to interact in a complex, but we recently showed that flagellar ODA8 does not copurify with ODA5 or ODA10 (Desai et al., 2015). Here we show that ODA5 and ODA10 depend on each other for stability and coexist in a complex in both cytoplasmic and flagellar extracts. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy reveal that ODA10 in flagella localizes strictly to a proximal region of doublet number one (DM1), which completely lacks ODAs in Chlamydomonas. Studies of the in vitro binding of ODAs to axonemal doublets reveal a role for the ODA5/ODA10 assembly complex in cytoplasmic maturation of ODAs into a form that can bind to doublet microtubules.},

  abstract = {HTRF (Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence) is the most frequently used generic assay technology to measure analytes in a homogenous format, which is the ideal platform used for drug target studies in high-throughput screening (HTS). This technology combines fluorescence resonance energy transfer technology (FRET) with time-resolved measurement (TR). In TR-FRET assays, a signal is generated through fluorescent resonance energy transfer between a donor and an acceptor molecule when in close proximity to each other. Buffer and media interference is dramatically reduced by dual-wavelength detection, and the final signal is proportional to the extent of product formation. The HTRF assay is usually sensitive and robust that can be miniaturized into the 384 and 1536-well plate formats. This assay technology has been applied to many antibody-based assays including GPCR signaling (cAMP and IP-One), kinases, cytokines and biomarkers, bioprocess (antibody and protein production), as well as the assays for protein-protein, proteinpeptide, and protein-DNA/RNA interactions.Since its introduction to the drug-screening world over ten years ago, researchers have used HTRF to expedite the study of GPCRs, kinases, new biomarkers, protein-protein interactions, and other targets of interest. HTRF has also been utilized as an alternative method for bioprocess monitoring. The first-generation HTRF technology, which uses Europium cryptate as a fluorescence donor to monitor reactions between biomolecules, was extended in 2008 through the introduction of a second-generation donor, Terbium cryptate (Tb), enhancing screening performance. Terbium cryptate possesses different photophysical properties compared to Europium, including increased quantum yield and a higher molar extinction coefficient. In addition to being compatible with the same acceptor fluorophors used with Europium, it can serve as a donor fluorophore to green-emitting fluors because it has multiple emission peaks including one at 490 nm. Moreover, all Terbium HTRF assays can be read on the same HTRF-compatible instruments as Europium HTRF assays.Overall, HTRF is a highly sensitive, robust technology for the detection of molecular interactions in vitro and is widely used for primary and secondary screening phases of drug development. This review addresses the general principles of HTRF and its current applications in drug discovery.},

  abstract = {Primary cilia are solitary, generally non-motile, hair-like protrusions that extend from the surface of cells between cell divisions. Their antenna-like structure leads naturally to the assumption that they sense the surrounding environment, the most common hypothesis being sensation of mechanical force through calcium-permeable ion channels within the cilium. This Ca(2+)-responsive mechanosensor hypothesis for primary cilia has been invoked to explain a large range of biological responses, from control of left-right axis determination in embryonic development to adult progression of polycystic kidney disease and some cancers. Here we report the complete lack of mechanically induced calcium increases in primary cilia, in tissues upon which this hypothesis has been based. We developed a transgenic mouse, Arl13b-mCherry-GECO1.2, expressing a ratiometric genetically encoded calcium indicator in all primary cilia. We then measured responses to flow in primary cilia of cultured kidney epithelial cells, kidney thick ascending tubules, crown cells of the embryonic node, kinocilia of inner ear hair cells, and several cell lines. Cilia-specific Ca(2+) influxes were not observed in physiological or even highly supraphysiological levels of fluid flow. We conclude that mechanosensation, if it originates in primary cilia, is not via calcium signalling.},

This process is essential for the assembly and maintenance of cilia and flagella: in the absence of IFT, cilia cannot assemble and, if IFT is arrested in ciliated cells, the cilia disassemble. The major IFT complex proteins and the major motor proteins, kinesin-2 and osm-3 (which transport particles from the cell body to ciliary tips) and cytoplasmic dynein 1b (which transports particles from ciliary tips to the cell body) have been identified. However, we have little understanding of the structure of the IFT particles, the cargo that these particles carry, how cargo is loaded and unloaded from the particles, or how the motor proteins are regulated. The focus of this chapter is to provide methods to observe and quantify the movements of IFT particles in Chlamydomonas flagella. IFT movements can be visualized in paralyzed or partially arrested flagella using either differential interference contrast (IFT) microscopy or, in cells with fluorescently tagged IFT components, with fluorescence microscopy. Methods for recording IFT movements and analyzing movements using kymograms are described.},

  abstract = {The transition zone (TZ) is a specialized region of the cilium characterized by Y-shaped connectors between the microtubules of the ciliary axoneme and the ciliary membrane [1]. Located near the base of the cilium, the TZ is in the prime location to act as a gate for proteins into and out of the ciliary compartment, a role supported by experimental evidence [2-6]. The importance of the TZ has been underscored by studies showing that mutations affecting proteins located in the TZ result in cilia-related diseases, or ciliopathies, presenting symptoms including renal cysts, retinal degeneration, and situs inversus [7-9]. Some TZ proteins have been identified and shown to interact with each other through coprecipitation studies in vertebrate cells [4, 10, 11] and genetics studies in C. elegans [3]. As a distinct approach to identify TZ proteins, we have taken advantage of the biology of Chlamydomonas to isolate TZs. Proteomic analysis identified 115 proteins, ten of which were known TZ proteins related to ciliopathies, indicating that the preparation was highly enriched for TZs. Interestingly, six proteins of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) were also associated with the TZs. Identification of these and other proteins in the TZ will provide new insights into functions of the TZ, as well as candidate ciliopathy genes.},

We have isolated four ypt genes, yptC1, yptC4, yptC5 and yptC6, from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Cr) genomic and cDNA libraries. Three of them, yptC1, yptC4 and yptC5, are close homologues of ypt genes previously found in the multicellular alga Volvox carteri (Vc), the fourth, yptC6, is new. Each yptC gene is present as a single copy in the genome. Comparisons of genomic and cDNA sequences revealed that the coding regions are interrupted by five (yptC5), six (yptC6), seven (yptC4) and eight (yptC1) introns, respectively. Cr ypt genes and the closely related Vc ypt genes have identical exon-intron structures, but the corresponding intron sequences are completely different. Polyadenylation is signalled by UAUAA, UGUAG and UGUAA. The deduced amino acid (aa) sequence of YptC6 exhibited 79% identity with HRab2; YptC1, YptC4 and YptC5 exhibited over 90% identity with their Vc homologues. Primary structures of the 9-aa 'effector domain' and the contiguous 'helix3-loop7' motif (approx. 30 aa) are 'diagnostic' features for functional assignment. Recombinant YptC proteins, overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified to near homogeneity, displayed strong and specific binding of GTP, but not of GMP or ATP. The four Cr Ypt proteins showed immunochemical cross reactions to their Vc counterparts. Moreover, Western blots demonstrated at least six types of Ypt in both Cr and Vc, suggesting that these Ypt are used for household functions responsible for vesicle transport rather than for cellular differentiation.},

This review summarizes pertinent and recent work on the effects on this organelle of monensin, brefeldin A, bafilomycin, ilimaquinone, okadaic acid, retinoic acid, and nocodazole. The molecular targets of monensin, brefeldin A, ilimaquinone, and retinoic acid remain to be elucidated whereas those for bafilomycin (vacuolar H+-ATPase), okadaic acid (serine/threonine phosphatases types 1, 2a, and 2b), and nocodazole (microtubules) are reasonably well understood. The molecular target of brefeldin has not been defined, but has been suggested to involve guanine nucleotide exchange proteins acting on ADP-ribosylation factor 1. Whether a defined molecular target can be found for monensin must be questioned since its main action consists in exchanging protons for Na+ which leads to osmotic swelling of post-Golgi endosomal structures and Golgi subcompartments by virtue of its membrane-associated effect as a cationophore. Brefeldin A was one of the most thoroughly investigated Golgi-disturbing agents and proved instrumental in unraveling retrograde flow mechanisms in the secretory pathways. Okadaic acid attracted interest for its properties mimicking mitotic fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus. Nocodazole was instrumental in establishing the cytoskeletal anchoring of the Golgi apparatus close to the microtubular organizing center.},

  abstract = {At late mitosis, the mother cell divides by the formation of a cleavage furrow, leaving two daughter cells connected by a thin intercellular bridge. During ingression of the cleavage furrow, the central spindle microtubules are compacted to form the structure known as the midbody (MB). The MB is situated within the intercellular bridge, with the abscission site sometimes occurring on one side of the MB. As a result of this one-sided (asymmetric) abscission, only one daughter cell can inherit the post-mitotic MB. Interestingly, recent studies have identified post-mitotic MBs as novel signaling platforms regulating stem cell fate and proliferation. Additionally, MBs were proposed to serve a role of polarity cues during the neurite outgrowth and apical lumen formation. Thus, abscission and MB inheritance is clearly a highly regulated cellular event that can affect development and various other cellular functions. In this review we discuss the latest findings regarding post-mitotic MB functions, as well as the machinery regulating MB inheritance and accumulation.},

  abstract = {The biogenesis, maintenance and function of primary cilia are controlled through intraflagellar transport (IFT) driven by two kinesin-2 family members, the heterotrimeric KIF3A/KIF3B/KAP complex and the homodimeric KIF17 motor. How these motors and their cargoes gain access to the ciliary compartment is poorly understood. Here, we identify a ciliary localization signal (CLS) in the KIF17 tail domain that is necessary and sufficient for ciliary targeting. Similarities between the CLS and classic nuclear localization signals (NLSs) suggest that similar mechanisms regulate nuclear and ciliary import. We hypothesize that ciliary targeting of KIF17 is regulated by a ciliary-cytoplasmic gradient of the small GTPase Ran, with high levels of GTP-bound Ran (RanGTP) in the cilium. Consistent with this, cytoplasmic expression of GTP-locked Ran(G19V) disrupts the gradient and abolishes ciliary entry of KIF17. Furthermore, KIF17 interacts with the nuclear import protein importin-beta2 in a manner dependent on the CLS and inhibited by RanGTP. We propose that Ran has a global role in regulating cellular compartmentalization by controlling the shuttling of cytoplasmic proteins into nuclear and ciliary compartments.},

Current methods for assaying cellular intermolecular interactions are mainly used for cells in culture and have limited use for the noninvasive assessment of small animal disease models. Here, we describe red light-emitting reporter systems based on bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) that allow for assaying PPIs both in cell culture and deep tissues of small animals. These BRET systems consist of the recently developed Renilla reniformis luciferase (RLuc) variants RLuc8 and RLuc8.6, used as BRET donors, combined with two red fluorescent proteins, TagRFP and TurboFP635, as BRET acceptors. In addition to the native coelenterazine luciferase substrate, we used the synthetic derivative coelenterazine-v, which further red-shifts the emission maxima of Renilla luciferases by 35 nm. We show the use of these BRET systems for ratiometric imaging of both cells in culture and deep-tissue small animal tumor models and validate their applicability for studying PPIs in mice in the context of rapamycin-induced FK506 binding protein 12 (FKBP12)-FKBP12 rapamycin binding domain (FRB) association. These red light-emitting BRET systems have great potential for investigating PPIs in the context of drug screening and target validation applications.},

In vitro and in vivo data indicate that Nlz1 acts downstream of Foxj1a and Wnt8a/presumed canonical Wnt signaling. Furthermore, Nlz1 contributes to motile cilia formation by positively regulating Wnt11/presumed non-canonical Wnt signaling. Together, our data suggest a novel role of nlz1 in ciliogenesis and the morphogenesis of multiple tissues.},

Using a GFP-tagged odorant receptor protein, Caenorhabditis elegans ODR-10, we characterized proteins sorting and transport in olfactory neurons in vivo. ODR-10 is transproted in rapidly moving dendritic vesicles that shuttle between the cell body and the cilia. Anterograde and retrograde vesicles move at different speeds, suggesting that dendrites have polarized transport mechanisms. Residues immediately after the seventh membrane spanning domain of ODR-10 are required for localization; these residues are conserved in many G-coupled receptors. UNC-101 encodes a u1 subunit of the AP-1 clathrin adaptor complex. In unc-101 mutants, dendritic vesicles are absent, ODR-10  receptor is evenly distributed over the plasma membrane, and other cilia membrane proteins are also mislocalized, implicating AP-1 in protein sorting to olfactory cilia.},

  abstract = {Vertebrate hedgehog signaling is coordinated by the differential localization of the receptors patched-1 and Smoothened in the primary cilium. Cilia assembly is mediated by intraflagellar transport (IFT), and cilia defects disrupt hedgehog signaling, causing many structural birth defects. We generated Ift25 and Ift27 knockout mice and show that they have structural birth defects indicative of hedgehog signaling dysfunction. Surprisingly, ciliary assembly is not affected, but abnormal hedgehog signaling is observed in conjunction with ciliary accumulation of patched-1 and Smoothened. Similarly, Smoothened accumulates in cilia on cells mutated for BBSome components or the BBS binding protein/regulator Lztfl1. Interestingly, the BBSome and Lztfl1 accumulate to high levels in Ift27 mutant cilia. Because Lztfl1 mutant cells accumulate BBSome but not IFT27, it is likely that Lztfl1 functions downstream of IFT27 to couple the BBSome to the IFT particle for coordinated removal of patched-1 and Smoothened from cilia during hedgehog signaling.},

However, one of the mammalian Crumbs proteins, Crumbs3 (CRB3) has an alternate splice form with a novel C-terminal sequence ending in CLPI (CRB3-CLPI). We report that CRB3-CLPI localizes to the cilia membrane and a membrane compartment at the mitotic spindle poles. Knockdown of CRB3-CLPI leads to both a loss of cilia and a multinuclear phenotype associated with centrosomal and spindle abnormalities. Using protein purification, we find that CRB3-CLPI interacts with importin beta-1 in a Ran-regulated fashion. Importin beta-1 colocalizes with CRB3-CLPI during mitosis, and a dominant-negative form of importin beta-1 closely phenocopies CRB3-CLPI knockdown. Knockdown of importin beta-1 blocks targeting of CRB3-CLPI to the spindle poles. Our data suggest an expanded role for Crumbs proteins in polarized membrane targeting and cell division via unique interactions with importin proteins.},

In Caenorhabditis elegans, DYF-1 serves as an essential activator for an anterograde motor OSM-3 of intraflagellar transport (IFT), the ciliogenesis-required motility that mediates the transport of flagellar precursors and removal of turnover products. In zebrafish and Tetrahymena DYF-1 influences the cilia tubulin posttranslational modification and may have more ubiquitous function in ciliogenesis than OSM-3. Here we address how DYF-1 biochemically interacts with the IFT machinery by using the model organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, in which the anterograde IFT does not depend on OSM-3. Our results show that this protein is a stoichiometric component of the IFT particle complex B and interacts directly with complex B subunit IFT46. In concurrence with the established IFT protein nomenclature, DYF-1 is also named IFT70 after the apparent size of the protein. IFT70/CrDYF-1 is essential for the function of IFT in building the flagellum because the flagella of IFT70/CrDYF-1-depleted cells were greatly shortened. Together, these results demonstrate that IFT70/CrDYF-1 is a canonical subunit of IFT particle complex B and strongly support the hypothesis that the IFT machinery has species- and tissue-specific variations with functional ramifications.},

  abstract = {Multiprotein complexes (MPCs) play a crucial role in cell signalling, since most proteins can be found in functional or regulatory complexes with other proteins (Sali, Glaeser et al. 2003). Thus, the study of protein-protein interaction networks requires the detailed characterization of MPCs to gain an integrative understanding of protein function and regulation. For identification and analysis, MPCs must be separated under native conditions. In this video, we describe the analysis of MPCs by blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE). BN-PAGE is a technique that allows separation of MPCs in a native conformation with a higher resolution than offered by gel filtration or sucrose density ultracentrifugation, and is therefore useful to determine MPC size, composition, and relative abundance (Schagger and von Jagow 1991); (Schagger, Cramer et al. 1994). By this method, proteins are separated according to their hydrodynamic size and shape in a polyacrylamide matrix. Here, we demonstrate the analysis of MPCs of total cellular lysates, pointing out that lysate dialysis is the crucial step to make BN-PAGE applicable to these biological samples. Using a combination of first dimension BN- and second dimension SDS-PAGE, we show that MPCs separated by BN-PAGE can be further subdivided into their individual constituents by SDS-PAGE. Visualization of the MPC components upon gel separation is performed by standard immunoblotting. As an example for MPC analysis by BN-PAGE, we chose the well-characterized eukaryotic 19S, 20S, and 26S proteasomes.},

In the late region the gene for the major protein VP1 overlaps those for proteins VP2 and VP3 over 122 nucleotides but is read in a different frame. The almost complete amino acid sequences of the two early proteins as well as those of the late proteins have been deduced from the nucleotide sequence. The mRNAs for the latter three proteins are presumably spliced out of a common primary RNA transcript. The use of degenerate codons is decidedly non-random, but is similar for the early and late regions. Codons of the type NUC, NCG and CGN are absent or very rare.},

  abstract = {The centrosome consists of a pair of centrioles and surrounding pericentriolar material (PCM). Many vertebrate cells also have an array of granules, termed centriolar satellites, that localize around the centrosome and are associated with centrosome and cilium function. Centriole duplication occurs once per cell cycle and is effected by a set of proteins including PLK4, CEP192, CEP152, CEP63, and CPAP. Information on the relationships between these components is limited due to the difficulty in assaying interactions in the context of the centrosome. Here, we used proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) to identify proximity interactions among centriole duplication proteins. PLK4, CEP192, and CEP152 BioID identified known physically interacting proteins and a new interaction between CEP152 and CDK5RAP2 consistent with a function of CEP152 in PCM recruitment. BioID for CEP63 and its paralog CCDC67 revealed extensive proximity interactions with centriolar satellite proteins. Focusing on these satellite proteins identified two new regulators of centriole duplication, CCDC14 and KIAA0753. Both proteins colocalize with CEP63 to satellites, bind to CEP63, and identify other satellite proteins by BioID. KIAA0753 positively regulates centriole duplication and CEP63 centrosome localization, whereas CCDC14 negatively regulates both processes. These results suggest that centriolar satellites have a previously unappreciated function in regulating centriole duplication.},

The BioID method relies on protein fusions to a promiscuous mutant of the Escherichia coli biotin ligase BirA, which biotinylates proteins that are in a approximately 10 nm labeling radius of the enzyme. The biotinylated proteins are captured by affinity and are identified by mass spectrometry. Proteins identified in this way are referred to as "proximity interactors." Application of BioID to a set of centrosome proteins demonstrated the utility of this approach in overcoming inherent limitations in probing centrosome structure. These studies also demonstrated the potential of BioID for building large-scale proximity interaction maps among centrosome proteins. In this chapter, we describe the work flow for identification of proximity interactions of centrosome proteins, including materials and methods for the generation and characterization of a BirA*-fusion protein expression plasmid, expression of BirA*-fusion proteins in cells, and purification and identification of proximity partners by mass spectrometry.},

We discuss how the singlet zone is linked to sensory and/or motile function, the contribution of the ciliary crown to ovocyte and mucosal propulsion, and the relationship between the ciliary cap and microtubule growth and shortening, and its relation to ciliary beat.

Our data support previous observations that Chlamydomonas is among the most diverse eukaryotic species. Nucleotide diversity is approximately 3% and is geographically structured in North America with some evidence of admixture among sampling locales. Examination of predicted loss-of-function mutations in field isolates indicates conservation of genes associated with core cellular functions, while genes in large gene families and poorly characterized genes show a greater incidence of major effect mutations. De novo assembly of unmapped reads recovered genes in the field isolates that are absent from the CC-503 assembly. The laboratory reference strains show a genomic pattern of polymorphism consistent with their origin as the recombinant progeny of a diploid zygospore. Large duplications or amplifications are a prominent feature of laboratory strains and appear to have originated under laboratory culture. Extensive natural variation offers a new source of genetic diversity for studies of Chlamydomonas, including naturally occurring alleles that may prove useful in studies of gene function and the dissection of quantitative genetic traits.},

  abstract = {Eukaryotic cells often use proteins localized to the ciliary membrane to monitor the extracellular environment. The mechanism by which proteins are sorted, specifically to this subdomain of the plasma membrane, is almost completely unknown. Previously, we showed that the IFT20 subunit of the intraflagellar transport particle is localized to the Golgi complex, in addition to the cilium and centrosome, and hypothesized that the Golgi pool of IFT20 plays a role in sorting proteins to the ciliary membrane. Here, we show that IFT20 is anchored to the Golgi complex by the golgin protein GMAP210/Trip11. Mice lacking GMAP210 die at birth with a pleiotropic phenotype that includes growth restriction, ventricular septal defects of the heart, omphalocele, and lung hypoplasia. Cells lacking GMAP210 have normal Golgi structure, but IFT20 is no longer localized to this organelle. GMAP210 is not absolutely required for ciliary assembly, but cilia on GMAP210 mutant cells are shorter than normal and have reduced amounts of the membrane protein polycystin-2 localized to them. This work suggests that GMAP210 and IFT20 function together at the Golgi in the sorting or transport of proteins destined for the ciliary membrane.},

  abstract = {Reporter genes have been successfully used in chloroplasts of higher plants, and high levels of recombinant protein expression have been reported. Reporter genes have also been used in the chloroplast of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, but in most cases the amounts of protein produced appeared to be very low. We hypothesized that the inability to achieve high levels of recombinant protein expression in the C. reinhardtii chloroplast was due to the codon bias seen in the C. reinhardtii chloroplast genome. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized a gene encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) de novo, optimizing its codon usage to reflect that of major C. reinhardtii chloroplast-encoded proteins. We monitored the accumulation of GFP in C. reinhardtii chloroplasts transformed with the codon-optimized GFP cassette (GFPct), under the control of the C. reinhardtii rbcL 5'- and 3'-UTRs. We compared this expression with the accumulation of GFP in C. reinhardtii transformed with a non-optimized GFP cassette (GFPncb), also under the control of the rbcL 5'- and 3'-UTRs. We demonstrate that C. reinhardtii chloroplasts transformed with the GFPct cassette accumulate approximately 80-fold more GFP than GFPncb-transformed strains. We further demonstrate that expression from the GFPct cassette, under control of the rbcL 5'- and 3'-UTRs, is sufficiently robust to report differences in protein synthesis based on subtle changes in environmental conditions, showing the utility of the GFPct gene as a reporter of C. reinhardtii chloroplast gene expression.},

  abstract = {For monitoring the expression profile of selected nuclear genes in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in response to altered environmental parameters or during cell cycle, in the past many RNA or protein samples had to be taken and analyzed by RNA hybridization or protein immunoblotting. Here we report the synthesis of a gene that codes for the luciferase of Renilla reniformis (RLuc) and is adapted to the nuclear codon usage of C. reinhardtii . This crluc gene was expressed alone or as a fusion to the zeocin resistance gene ble under control of different promoter variants. Luciferase activity was monitored in living cells, increased with the promoter strength and paralleled the amount of expressed protein. Under control of the Lhcb-1 promoter the Luc-activity in synchronized cultures was dependent on the dark-light cycle. Additionally, crluc was placed under control of the Chop-2 promoter and activity was measured under different light conditions. Chop-2 promoter activity was found to be most pronouced under low-light and dark conditions, further supporting that channelrhodopsin-2 is most active in dark-adapted cells. We conclude that crluc is a reliable tool for convenient monitoring of nuclear gene expression in C. reinhardtii .},

  abstract = {Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a widely used reference organism in studies of photosynthesis, cilia, and biofuels. Most research in this field uses a few dozen standard laboratory strains that are reported to share a common ancestry, but exhibit substantial phenotypic differences. In order to facilitate ongoing Chlamydomonas research and explain the phenotypic variation, we mapped the genetic diversity within these strains using whole-genome resequencing. We identified 524,640 single nucleotide variants and 4812 structural variants among 39 commonly used laboratory strains. Nearly all (98.2%) of the total observed genetic diversity was attributable to the presence of two, previously unrecognized, alternate haplotypes that are distributed in a mosaic pattern among the extant laboratory strains. We propose that these two haplotypes are the remnants of an ancestral cross between two strains with approximately 2% relative divergence. These haplotype patterns create a fingerprint for each strain that facilitates the positive identification of that strain and reveals its relatedness to other strains. The presence of these alternate haplotype regions affects phenotype scoring and gene expression measurements. Here, we present a rich set of genetic differences as a community resource to allow researchers to more accurately conduct and interpret their experiments with Chlamydomonas.},

NgAgo binds 5' phosphorylated single-stranded guide DNA (gDNA) of approximately 24 nucleotides, efficiently creates site-specific DNA double-strand breaks when loaded with the gDNA. The NgAgo-gDNA system does not require a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM), as does Cas9, and preliminary characterization suggests a low tolerance to guide-target mismatches and high efficiency in editing (G+C)-rich genomic targets.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transformation of microalgae to obtain recombinant proteins, lipids or metabolites of economic value is of growing interest due to low costs associated with culture growth and scaling up. At present there are only three stable nuclear selection markers for the transformation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which is the most commonly transformed microalgae, specifically: the aminoglycoside phosphotransferaseses aph7and aphVIII and the phleomycin resistance ble gene. As several microalgae are resistant to some of the antibiotics associated with the mentioned resistance genes, we have developed another alternative, tetX, a NADP-requiring Oxidoreductase that hydroxylates tetracycline substrates. We provide evidence that tetX can be used to obtain nuclear transformants of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. RESULTS: We obtained nuclear transformants harbouring the tetX gene under the control of beta 2 tubulin or HSP70ARBCS2 promoters at an efficiency of transformation of 3.28 and 6.18 colony forming units/mug DNA respectively. This is the first report of a eukaryotic cell transformed using tetracycline as a selectable marker. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a protocol for the nuclear transformation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii using tetX as a selectable marker that confers stable resistance to tetracycline up to 100 mug/mL. We believe tetX can be used to transform Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplasts, related microalgae and other aerobic organisms sensitive to any tetracycline antibiotic.},

  abstract = {Primary cilia interpret vertebrate Hedgehog (Hh) signals. Why cilia are essential for signaling is unclear. One possibility is that some forms of signaling require a distinct membrane lipid composition, found at cilia. We found that the ciliary membrane contains a particular phosphoinositide, PI(4)P, whereas a different phosphoinositide, PI(4,5)P2, is restricted to the membrane of the ciliary base. This distribution is created by Inpp5e, a ciliary phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase. Without Inpp5e, ciliary PI(4,5)P2 levels are elevated and Hh signaling is disrupted. Inpp5e limits the ciliary levels of inhibitors of Hh signaling, including Gpr161 and the PI(4,5)P2-binding protein Tulp3. Increasing ciliary PI(4,5)P2 levels or conferring the ability to bind PI(4)P on Tulp3 increases the ciliary localization of Tulp3. Lowering Tulp3 in cells lacking Inpp5e reduces ciliary Gpr161 levels and restores Hh signaling. Therefore, Inpp5e regulates ciliary membrane phosphoinositide composition, and Tulp3 reads out ciliary phosphoinositides to control ciliary protein localization, enabling Hh signaling.},

We examined PC2 expression in several tissues and cells lacking PC1 and found that PC2 is expressed in cilia independently of PC1. We used N-terminal deletion constructs to narrow the domain necessary for cilia trafficking to the first 15 amino acids of PC2 and identified a conserved motif, R6VxP, that is required for cilial localization. The N-terminal 15 amino acids are also sufficient to localize heterologous proteins in cilia.

In these embryos, cilia-mediated signaling was severely disturbed. Defects in Shh signaling suggested that the Rpgrip1l deficiency causes an impairment of protein degradation and protein processing. Indeed, we detected a cilia-dependent decreased proteasomal activity in the absence of Rpgrip1l. We found different proteasomal components localized to cilia and identified Psmd2, a component of the regulatory proteasomal 19S subunit, as an interaction partner for Rpgrip1l. Quantifications of proteasomal substrates demonstrated that Rpgrip1l regulates proteasomal activity specifically at the basal body. Our study suggests that Rpgrip1l controls ciliary signaling by regulating the activity of the ciliary proteasome via Psmd2.},

  abstract = {The yeast karyopherin heterodimer Kap60p.Kap95p facilitates nuclear import of proteins bearing a classic nuclear localization signal (NLS). The alpha subunit Kap60p binds to the NLS of cargo molecules in the cytoplasm, forming stable complexes that must ultimately dissociate in the nucleoplasm. Although Kap60p can release NLSs on its own using an autoinhibitory sequence (AIS) motif that can occupy the NLS binding site, that mechanism is too slow to support rapid nuclear import. We previously showed that the nuclear basket nucleoporin Nup2p and the exportin complex Cse1p.Gsp1p.GTP function as karyopherin release factors (KaRFs) because they can accelerate the rate of dissociation of NLSs from Kap60p. Here we dissect the molecular mechanics of their KaRF activity. We show that Cse1p accelerates dissociation of Kap60p.NLS-cargo complexes and Kap60p.Nup2p complexes by increasing the affinity of Kap60p for its AIS motif. In contrast, Nup2p uses a conserved sequence motif (VMXXRKIA) coupled to an AIS-like motif to accelerate dissociation of Kap60p.NLS complexes in a vectorial reaction mechanism. Mutation of either motif in Nup2p leads to a loss of KaRF activity and to the accumulation of Kap60p.NLS-cargo complexes in the nucleoplasm of yeast. We discuss a model whereby Nup2p, Cse1p, and Gsp1p cooperate to establish directionality in the movement of Kap60p and NLS-cargos across the nuclear pore complex.},

Here, we show that Tau tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2) is a dedicated regulator of the initiation of ciliogenesis in vivo. We identified a null allele of mouse Ttbk2 based on loss of Sonic hedgehog activity, a signaling pathway that requires the primary cilium. Despite a normal basal body template, Ttbk2 mutants lack cilia. TTBK2 acts at the distal end of the basal body, where it promotes the removal of CP110, which caps the mother centriole, and promotes recruitment of IFT proteins, which build the ciliary axoneme. Dominant truncating mutations in human TTBK2 cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 11 (SCA11); these mutant proteins do not promote ciliogenesis and inhibit ciliogenesis in wild-type cells. We propose that cell-cycle regulators target TTBK2 to the basal body, where it modifies specific targets to initiate ciliogenesis.},

This study evaluates ultrasonic cell disruption as a processing step that fractionates microalgae. A range of species types with different sizes and cell wall compositions were treated. The initial seconds of sonication offered the most significant disruption, even for the more durable Nannochloropsis cells. Following this initial period, diminishing effectiveness was attributed, by acoustic measurements, to attenuation of the ultrasound in the ensuing cloud of cavitating bubbles. At longer exposure times, differences between species were more pronounced. Processing higher concentrations of Isochrysis slowed cell disintegration only marginally, making the expenditure of energy more worthwhile.},

  abstract = {Yellow mutants of the green fluorescent protein (YFP) are crucial constituents of genetically encoded indicators of signal transduction and fusions to monitor protein-protein interactions. However, previous YFPs show excessive pH sensitivity, chloride interference, poor photostability, or poor expression at 37 degrees C. Protein evolution in Escherichia coli has produced a new YFP named Citrine, in which the mutation Q69M confers a much lower pK(a) (5.7) than for previous YFPs, indifference to chloride, twice the photostability of previous YFPs, and much better expression at 37 degrees C and in organelles. The halide resistance is explained by a 2.2-A x-ray crystal structure of Citrine, showing that the methionine side chain fills what was once a large halide-binding cavity adjacent to the chromophore. Insertion of calmodulin within Citrine or fusion of cyan fluorescent protein, calmodulin, a calmodulin-binding peptide and Citrine has generated improved calcium indicators. These chimeras can be targeted to multiple cellular locations and have permitted the first single-cell imaging of free [Ca(2+)] in the Golgi. Citrine is superior to all previous YFPs except when pH or halide sensitivity is desired and is particularly advantageous within genetically encoded fluorescent indicators of physiological signals.},

  abstract = {The developmental transition from a vegetative to a reproductive phase (i.e., flowering) is timed by the seasonal cue day length or photoperiod in many plant species. Through the photoperiod pathway, inductive day lengths trigger the production of a systemic flowering signal, florigen, to provoke the floral transition. FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), widely conserved in angiosperms, is a major component of the mobile florigen. In the long-day plant Arabidopsis, FT expression is rhythmically activated by the output of the photoperiod pathway CONSTANS (CO), specifically at the end of long days. How FT expression is modulated at an adequate level in response to the long-day cue to set a proper flowering time remains unknown. Here, we report a periodic histone deacetylation mechanism for the photoperiodic modulation of FT expression. We have identified a plant-unique core structural component of an Arabidopsis histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex. In long days, this component accumulates at dusk, and is recruited by a MADS-domain transcription factor to the FT locus specifically at the end of the day, leading to periodic histone deacetylation of FT chromatin at dusk. Furthermore, we found that at the end of long days CO activity not only activates FT expression but also enables HDAC-activity recruitment to FT chromatin to dampen the level of FT expression, and so prevent precocious flowering in response to the inductive long-day cue. These results collectively reveal a periodic histone deacetylation mechanism for the day-length control of flowering time in higher plants.},

The biological functions of CDK10/CycM and etiology of STAR syndrome are poorly understood. Here, we report that deficiency of CDK10/Cyclin M promotes assembly and elongation of primary cilia. We establish that this reflects a key role for CDK10/Cyclin M in regulation of actin network organization, which is known to govern ciliogenesis. In an unbiased screen, we identified the RhoA-associated kinase PKN2 as a CDK10/CycM phosphorylation substrate. We establish that PKN2 is a bone fide regulator of ciliogenesis, acting in a similar manner to CDK10/CycM. We discovered that CDK10/Cyclin M binds and phosphorylates PKN2 on threonines 121 and 124, within PKN2's core RhoA-binding domain. Furthermore, we demonstrate that deficiencies in CDK10/CycM or PKN2, or expression of a non-phosphorylatable version of PKN2, destabilize both the RhoA protein and the actin network architecture. Importantly, we established that ectopic expression of RhoA is sufficient to override the induction of ciliogenesis resulting from CDK10/CycM knockdown, indicating that RhoA regulation is critical for CDK10/CycM's negative effect on ciliogenesis. Finally, we show that kidney sections from a STAR patient display dilated renal tubules and abnormal, elongated cilia. Altogether, these results reveal CDK10/CycM as a key regulator of actin dynamics and a suppressor of ciliogenesis through phosphorylation of PKN2 and promotion of RhoA signaling. Moreover, they suggest that STAR syndrome is a ciliopathy.},

The spokes that emanate from two such rings associate into a layer, with a vertical periodicity of 17 nanometers on the cartwheel margin.

As the results, a total of 34 proteins were identified and most of them were novel MIP-T3 putative partners. The MIP-T3-associated proteins could be grouped into nine clusters based on their molecule functions, including cytoskeleton, chaperone, nucleic acid binding, kinase and so on. Three MIP-T3-interacted proteins - actin, HSPA8 and tubulin - were further confirmed by reciprocal coimmunoprecipitations and colocalization analysis. The interaction of MIP-T3 with both actin filaments and microtubule suggested that MIP-T3 may play an important role in regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics in cells. Our results therefore not only uncover a large number of MIP-T3-associated proteins that possess a variety of cellular functions, but also provide new research directions for the study of the functions of MIP-T3.},

  abstract = {Eukaryotic flagella and cilia are highly dynamic organelles. In green algae like Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, flagella absorption and resynthesis is a normal process during the vegetative cell cycle. Rapid regeneration also occurs after stress-induced shedding of flagella. Ca2+ ions, protein synthesis, and a kinase activity are the main factors known to affect resynthesis. Recently, we have detected that certain small G proteins (Ypt/Rab) and a GTPase regulator (GDP dissociation inhibitor), known as regulatory elements of intracellular vesicle transport, are present in flagellar membranes of green algae, raising the possibility that the organelle's synthesis and/or integrity depends on functional membrane traffic. In this study, we examined the effect of brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of intracellular membrane flow and Golgi function in animal and plant cells, on flagella regeneration in the colonial green alga Gonium pectorale. We show that low BFA concentrations (< 1 microgram/ml) inhibit flagella out-growth, while higher amounts cause dose-dependent deflagellation and cell death. Our findings provide experimental evidence for a direct connection between intracellular transport and eukaryotic flagella synthesis.},

Here we developed far-red mNeptune-based bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and trimolecular fluorescence complementation (TriFC) systems with excitation and emission above 600 nm in the 'tissue optical window' for imaging of protein-protein and RNA-protein interactions in live cells and mice. The far-red mNeptune BiFC was first built by selecting appropriate split mNeptune fragments, and then the mNeptune-TriFC system was built based on the mNeptune-BiFC system. The newly constructed mNeptune BiFC and TriFC systems were verified as useful tools for imaging protein-protein and mRNA-protein interactions, respectively, in live cells and mice. We then used the new mNeptune-TriFC system to investigate the interactions between human polypyrimidine-tract-binding protein (PTB) and HIV-1 mRNA elements as PTB may participate in HIV mRNA processing in HIV activation from latency. An interaction between PTB and the 3'long terminal repeat region of HIV-1 mRNAs was found and imaged in live cells and mice, implying a role for PTB in regulating HIV-1 mRNA processing. The study provides new tools for in vivo imaging of RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions, and adds new insight into the mechanism of HIV-1 mRNA processing.},

  abstract = {Recently, five members of the somatostatin receptor family have been cloned. However, little is known about their cellular and subcellular localization in the central nervous system. Using specific anti-peptide antisera, we observed somatostatin receptor 3-like immunoreactivity in many brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, amygdala and cerebellum. In all of these regions (except for the cerebellar cortex), somatostatin receptor 3-like immunoreactivity was selectively targeted to 4-8-microm-long rod-shaped profiles which did not co-localize with axonal or dendritic markers. One immunoreactive profile was always associated with one neuronal cell body. This staining pattern was resistant to colchicine treatment and showed a closely overlapping distribution with somatostatin receptor 3 messenger RNA, suggesting that the receptor protein is not transported over long distances. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that somatostatin receptor 3-like immunoreactivity is localized to the plasma membrane of neuronal cilia which extended into an intercellular pocket and showed a 9+0 filament pattern in their basal body and proximal segments. Thus, somatostatin receptor 3 demonstrates a unique example of a G-protein-coupled receptor not localized to "classical" pre- or postsynaptic sites, but selectively targeted to neuronal cilia. The presence of the somatostatin receptor 3 receptor on neuronal cilia suggests that these presumably non-motile cilia may not merely represent developmental remnants, but rather function as chemical sensors of the immediate milieu.},

  abstract = {In Chlorophycean algal cells, these organelles are generally called microbodies because they lack the enzymes found in the peroxisomes of higher plants. Microbodies in some algae contain fewer enzymes than the peroxisomes of higher plants, and some unicellular green algae in Chlorophyceae such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii do not possess catalase, an enzyme commonly found in peroxisomes. Thus, whether microbodies in Chlorophycean algae are similar to the peroxisomes of higher plants, and whether they use a similar transport mechanism for the peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS), remain unclear. To determine whether the PTS is present in the microbodies of Chlorophycean algae, and to visualize the microbodies in Chlamydomonas cells, we examined the sub-cellular localization of green fluorescent proteins (GFP) fused to several PTS-like sequences. We detected GFP compartments that were spherical with a diameter of 0.3-1.0 mum in transgenic Chlamydomonas. Comparative analysis of the character of GFP-compartments observed by fluorescence microscopy and that of microbodies by electron microscopy indicated that the compartments were one and the same. The result also showed that the microbodies in Chlorophycean cells have a similar transport mechanism to that of peroxisomes of higher plants.},

Here we show that Kif7 localizes to the cilium tip, the site of microtubule plus ends, where it limits cilium length and controls cilium structure. Purified recombinant Kif7 binds the plus ends of growing microtubules in vitro, where it reduces the rate of microtubule growth and increases the frequency of microtubule catastrophe. Kif7 is not required for normal intraflagellar transport or for trafficking of Hh pathway proteins into cilia. Instead, a central function of Kif7 in the mammalian Hh pathway is to control cilium architecture and to create a single cilium tip compartment, where Gli-Sufu activity can be correctly regulated.},

They are thought to assemble around a nine-fold symmetric cartwheel structure established by SAS-6 proteins. Here, we have engineered Chlamydomonas reinhardtii SAS-6-based oligomers with symmetries ranging from five- to ten-fold. Expression of a SAS-6 mutant that forms six-fold symmetric cartwheel structures in vitro resulted in cartwheels and centrioles with eight- or nine-fold symmetries in vivo. In combination with Bld10 mutants that weaken cartwheel-microtubule interactions, this SAS-6 mutant produced six- to eight-fold symmetric cartwheels. Concurrently, the microtubule wall maintained eight- and nine-fold symmetries. Expressing SAS-6 with analogous mutations in human cells resulted in nine-fold symmetric centrioles that exhibited impaired length and organization. Together, our data suggest that the self-assembly properties of SAS-6 instruct cartwheel symmetry, and lead us to propose a model in which the cartwheel and the microtubule wall assemble in an interdependent manner to establish the native architecture of centrioles.},

  abstract = {Nephronophthisis (NPHP), an autosomal recessive cystic kidney disease, represents the most frequent genetic cause of end-stage kidney disease in the first three decades of life. Contrary to polycystic kidney disease, NPHP shows normal or diminished kidney size, cysts are concentrated at the corticomedullary junction, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis is dominant. NPHP can be associated with retinitis pigmentosa (Senior-Loken syndrome), liver fibrosis, and cerebellar vermis aplasia (Joubert syndrome) in approximately 10% of patients. Positional cloning of six novel genes (NPHP1 through 6) as mutated in NPHP and functional characterization of their encoded proteins have contributed to the concept of "ciliopathies." It has helped advance a new unifying theory of cystic kidney diseases. This theory states that the products of all genes that are mutated in cystic kidney diseases in humans, mice, or zebrafish are expressed in primary cilia or centrosomes of renal epithelial cells. Primary cilia are sensory organelles that connect mechanosensory, visual, osmotic, and other stimuli to mechanisms of cell-cycle control and epithelial cell polarity. The ciliary theory explains the multiple organ involvement in NPHP regarding retinitis pigmentosa, liver fibrosis, ataxia, situs inversus, and mental retardation. Mutations in NPHP genes cause defects in signaling mechanisms, including the noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway. The "ciliopathy" NPHP thereby is caused by defects in tissue differentiation and maintenance as a result of impaired processing of extracellular cues. Nephrocystins, the proteins that are encoded by NPHP genes, are highly conserved in evolution. Positional cloning of additional causative genes of NPHP will elucidate further signaling mechanisms that are involved, thereby establishing therapeutic approaches using animal models in mouse, zebrafish, and Caenorhabditis elegans.},

The leftward movement of fluid at the ventral node, called nodal flow, is the central process in symmetry breaking on the left-right axis. Nodal flow is autonomously generated by the rotation of cilia that are tilted toward the posterior on cells of the ventral node. These cilia are built by transport via the KIF3 motor complex. How nodal flow is interpreted to create left-right asymmetry has been a matter of debate. Recent evidence suggests that the leftward movement of membrane-sheathed particles, called nodal vesicular parcels (NVPs), may result in the activation of the non-canonical Hedgehog signaling pathway, an asymmetric elevation in intracellular Ca(2+) and changes in gene expression.},

The divergent actin NAP (for “novel actin-like protein”) is expressed only negligibly in wild-type cells but abundantly in a null mutant of conventional actin, the ida5 mutant. The presence of the dormant NAP gene suggests that NAP may also have its own function in wild-type cells under some conditions. However, no specific functions have been suggested. In this study, we examined the expression of actin and NAP in wild-type and ida5 cells under conditions where actin function has been shown to be important. We found that deflagellation induces the expression of NAP as well as that of actin in wild-type cells. The expressed NAP becomes localized to the regrown flagella, apparently without being associated with dynein. Mating of gametes also increased the expression of actin in wild-type cells and that of NAP in ida5 cells, resulting in accumulation of these proteins in flagella (in both wild-type and ida5 cells) and the fertilization tubule (only in wild-type cells). However, it did not induce significant NAP expression in wild-type cells. These and other observations suggest that the expression of actin and NAP mRNAs is controlled by two discrete mechanisms and that NAP plays a role in flagellar formation in wild-type cells.},

This comprehensive review discusses recent advances in understanding the effects of major environmental stresses and the characteristics of various engineering operation strategies on the production of biofuels (mainly biodiesel and bioethanol) using microalgae. The performances of microalgae-based biofuel-producing systems under various environmental stresses (i.e., irradiance, temperature, pH, nitrogen depletion, and salinity) and cultivation strategies (i.e., fed-batch, semi-continuous, continuous, two-stage, and salinity-gradient) are compared. The reasons for variations in performance and the underlying theories of the various production strategies are also critically discussed. The aim of this review is to provide useful information to facilitate development of innovative and feasible operation technologies for effectively increasing the commercial viability of microalgae-based biofuel production.},

We find that there is a complicated, but monotonic quantitative relationship between the affinity of an NLS for the import receptor, importin alpha, and the steady-state accumulation of the cargo in the nucleus. This analysis takes into consideration the impact of protein size. In addition, the hypothetical upper limit to an NLS affinity for the receptors is explored through genetic approaches. Overall, our results indicate that there is a correlation between the binding affinity of an NLS cargo for the NLS receptor, importin alpha, and the import rate for this cargo. This correlation, however, is not maintained for cargoes that bind to the NLS receptor with very weak or very strong affinity.},

  abstract = {Streptavidin and avidin are used ubiquitously because of the remarkable affinity of their biotin binding, but they are tetramers, which disrupts many of their applications. Making either protein monomeric reduces affinity by at least 10(4)-fold because part of the binding site comes from a neighboring subunit. Here we engineered a streptavidin tetramer with only one functional biotin binding subunit that retained the affinity, off rate and thermostability of wild-type streptavidin. In denaturant, we mixed a streptavidin variant containing three mutations that block biotin binding with wild-type streptavidin in a 3:1 ratio. Then we generated monovalent streptavidin by refolding and nickel-affinity purification. Similarly, we purified defined tetramers with two or three biotin binding subunits. Labeling of site-specifically biotinylated neuroligin-1 with monovalent streptavidin allowed stable neuroligin-1 tracking without cross-linking, whereas wild-type streptavidin aggregated neuroligin-1 and disrupted presynaptic contacts. Monovalent streptavidin should find general application in biomolecule labeling, single-particle tracking and nanotechnology.},

Despite its importance, understanding of midbody assembly and its regulation is still limited. Here we describe how the structural composition of the midbody changes during progression throughout cytokinesis and explore the functional implications of these changes. Deriving from midzones, midbodies are organized by a set of microtubule interacting proteins that colocalize to a zone of microtubule overlap in the center. We found that these proteins split into three subgroups that relocalize to different parts of the midbody: the bulge, the dark zone, and the flanking zone. We characterized these relocalizations and defined domain requirements for three key proteins: MKLP1, KIF4, and PRC1. Two cortical proteins-anillin and RhoA-localized to presumptive abscission sites in mature midbodies, where they may regulate the endosomal sorting complex required for transport machinery. Finally, we characterized the role of Plk1, a key regulator of cytokinesis, in midbody assembly. Our findings represent the most detailed description of midbody assembly and maturation to date and may help elucidate how abscission sites are positioned and regulated.},

  abstract = {The unicellular green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a classic model for the study of flagella/cilia and photosynthesis and recently it also has been exploited for producing biopharmaceuticals and biofuel. Due to the low frequency of homologous recombination, reverse genetic manipulation in Chlamydomonas relies mainly on miRNA and siRNA-based knockdown methods. However, the difficulty in constructing artificial miRNA vectors, laborious screening of knockdown transformants, and undesired epigenetic silencing of exogenous miRNA constructs limit their application. We have established a one-step procedure to construct an artificial miRNA precursor by annealing eight ~40nt oligonucleotides. In the final construct, the Gussia luciferase (G-luc) gene is positioned between the promotor and the artificial miRNA precursor so that knockdown strains can quickly be screened by visualizing luciferase luminescence with a photon-counting camera. Furthermore, the luciferase activity of transformants correlates with the knockdown level of two test target proteins: the chloroplast protein VIPP1 (Vesicle Inducing Protein in Plastids 1) and the flagellar protein CDPK3 (Calcium Dependent Protein Kinase 3). Adding an intron from RBCS2 (Ribulose Bisphosphate Carboxylase/Oxygenase Small Subunit 2) to the miRNA construct enhanced both the luciferase activity and the miRNA knockdown efficiency. A second miRNA vector incorporates the promotor of the nitrate reductase gene to allow inducible expression of the artificial miRNA. These vectors will facilitate the application of the artificial miRNA, provide tools for studying the mechanism of epigenetics in Chlamydomonas and can also be adapted for use in other model organisms.

They are structurally polarized, and the mechanisms by which these organelles are disassembled are incompletely understood. Here, we show that flagellar resorption occurs in two distinct phases of length-dependent regulation. A CDK-like kinase, encoded by flagellar shortening 1 (FLS1), is required for the normal rate of disassembly of only the distal part of the flagellum. Mechanistically, loss of function of FLS1 prevents the initial phosphorylation of CALK, an aurora-like kinase that regulates flagellar shortening, and induces the earlier onset of the inhibitory phosphorylation of CrKinesin13, a microtubule depolymerase, which is involved in flagellar shortening. In addition, CALK and CrKinesin13 phosphorylation can also be induced by the process of flagellar shortening itself, demonstrating an example of cilia-generated signaling not requiring the binding of a ligand or the stimulation of an ion channel.},

Kinesin-2 is well known for its role in intraflagellar transport to transport ciliary precursors and signaling molecules. Recently, microtubule-depolymerizing kinesins found in kinesin-8, -13, and -14A families have emerged as regulators of cilia.

We demonstrate that Importin beta2 is necessary for localization of RP2 to the primary cilium because ablation of Importin beta2 by shRNA blocks entry both of endogenous and exogenous RP2 to the cilium. Furthermore, we identify two distinct binding sites of RP2, which interact independently with Importin beta2. One binding site is a nuclear localization signal (NLS)-like sequence that is located at the N-terminus of RP2 and the other is an M9-like sequence within the tubulin folding cofactor C (TBCC) domain. Mutation of the NLS-like consensus sequence did not abolish localization of RP2 to cilia, suggesting that the sequence is not essential for RP2 ciliary targeting. Interestingly, we found that several missense mutations that cause human disease fall within the M9-like sequence of RP2 and these mutations block entry of RP2 into the cilium, as well as its interaction with Importin beta2. Together, this work further highlights a role of Importin beta2 in regulation of the entry of RP2 and other proteins into the ciliary compartment.},

  abstract = {Stem cell niches provide resident stem cells with signals that specify their identity. Niche signals act over a short range such that only stem cells but not their differentiating progeny receive the self-renewing signals. However, the cellular mechanisms that limit niche signalling to stem cells remain poorly understood. Here we show that the Drosophila male germline stem cells form previously unrecognized structures, microtubule-based nanotubes, which extend into the hub, a major niche component. Microtubule-based nanotubes are observed specifically within germline stem cell populations, and require intraflagellar transport proteins for their formation. The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor Tkv localizes to microtubule-based nanotubes. Perturbation of microtubule-based nanotubes compromises activation of Dpp signalling within germline stem cells, leading to germline stem cell loss. Moreover, Dpp ligand and Tkv receptor interaction is necessary and sufficient for microtubule-based nanotube formation. We propose that microtubule-based nanotubes provide a novel mechanism for selective receptor-ligand interaction, contributing to the short-range nature of niche-stem-cell signalling.},

Importantly, BRET also allows for monitoring of protein-protein interactions, in real time, in intact living cells that can be submitted to various stimuli. Moreover, quantitative BRET analysis also permits a pharmacological approach of protein-protein interactions, allowing one to determine whether a given stimulus induces a conformational change within preassociated partners or increases the association (recruitment) between two separated partners. Determination of the proportion of the dimeric vs monomeric form of a protein in the cell also is possible. Therefore, the BRET technology can be considered as a new and powerful tool in the field of protein-protein interactions.},

  abstract = {PCR fragments and linear vectors containing overlapping ends are easily assembled into a propagative plasmid by homologous recombination in Escherichia coli. Although this gap-repair cloning approach is straightforward, its existence is virtually unknown to most molecular biologists. To popularize this method, we tested critical parameters influencing the efficiency of PCR fragments cloning into PCR-amplified vectors by homologous recombination in the widely used E. coli strain DH5alpha. We found that the number of positive colonies after transformation increases with the length of overlap between the PCR fragment and linear vector. For most practical purposes, a 20 bp identity already ensures high-cloning yields. With an insert to vector ratio of 2:1, higher colony forming numbers are obtained when the amount of vector is in the range of 100 to 250 ng. An undesirable cloning background of empty vectors can be minimized during vector PCR amplification by applying a reduced amount of plasmid template or by using primers in which the 5' termini are separated by a large gap. DpnI digestion of the plasmid template after PCR is also effective to decrease the background of negative colonies. We tested these optimized cloning parameters during the assembly of five independent DNA constructs and obtained 94% positive clones out of 100 colonies probed. We further demonstrated the efficient and simultaneous cloning of two PCR fragments into a vector. These results support the idea that homologous recombination in E. coli might be one of the most effective methods for cloning one or two PCR fragments. For its simplicity and high efficiency, we believe that recombinational cloning in E. coli has a great potential to become a routine procedure in most molecular biology-oriented laboratories.},

  abstract = {Nonmotile cilia on olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) compartmentalize signaling molecules, including odorant receptors and cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels, allowing for efficient, spatially confined responses to sensory stimuli . Little is known about the mechanisms of the ciliary targeting of olfactory CNG channels, composed of three subunits: CNGA2, CNGA4, and CNGB1b . Recent reports suggest that subunit composition of the retinal CNG channel influences localization, leading to disease . However, the mechanistic role of subunits in properly targeting native olfactory CNG channels remains unclear. Here, we show that heteromeric assembly with CNGB1b, containing a critical carboxy-terminal motif (RVxP), is required for ciliary trafficking of olfactory CNG channels. Movement of proteins within the cilia is governed by intraflagellar transport (IFT), a process that facilitates bidirectional movement of cargo along microtubules. Work in C. elegans has established that heterotrimeric and homodimeric kinesin-2 family members play a critical role in anterograde transport . In mammalian systems, the heterotrimeric KIF3a/KIF3b/KAP-3 complex plays a clear role in IFT; however, no role has been established for KIF17, the mammalian homolog of OSM-3 . Here, we demonstrate that KIF17 is required for olfactory CNG channel targeting, providing novel insights into mechanisms of mammalian ciliary transport.},

  abstract = {Impaired ciliary protein transport in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) leads to anosmia, and is a newly recognized clinical manifestation of a class of human disorders called ciliopathies. Surprisingly little is known regarding the mechanisms controlling trafficking to this unique neuronal compartment. Here, we show a novel role for phosphofurin acidic cluster-sorting protein 1 (PACS-1) in the ciliary trafficking of the olfactory cyclic-nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel. PACS-1 is an intracellular sorting protein that mediates its effects through the binding of acidic clusters on cargo protein. This interaction is dependent on CK2 phosphorylation of both PACS-1 and its cargo. We show that CNGB1b contains two putative PACS-1 binding sites, which are phosphorylated by the serine/threonine protein kinase, CK2. Additionally, we show that PACS-1 is expressed in OSNs and interacts in complex with the CNG channel. CK2 inhibition in native OSNs causes a loss of CNG channel from cilia and subsequent olfactory dysfunction, while adenoviral expression of mutant PACS-1 causes similar mislocalization. These results provide a mechanism for the subunit-dependent ciliary trafficking of the CNG channel and offer insight into the mechanisms of ciliary transport.},

BuGZ coacervation and its binding to microtubules and tubulin are required to promote assembly of spindle and spindle matrix in Xenopus egg extract and in mammalian cells.

Initial attempts to apply this technology to the model, single cell alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii failed to yield cells containing edited genes. To determine if the Cas9 and single guide RNA (sgRNA) genes were functional in C. reinhardtii, we tested the ability of a codon-optimized Cas9 gene along with one of four different sgRNAs to cause targeted gene disruption during a 24-hour period immediately following transformation. All three exogenously supplied gene targets as well as the endogenous FKB12 (rapamycin sensitivity) gene of C. reinhardtii displayed distinct Cas9/sgRNA-mediated target site modifications as determined by DNA sequencing of cloned PCR amplicons of the target site region. Success in transient expression of Cas9 and sgRNA genes contrasted with the recovery of only a single rapamycin resistant colony bearing an appropriately modified FKB12 target site in 16 independent transformation experiments involving >109 cells. Failure to recover transformants with intact or expressed Cas9 genes following transformation with the Cas9 gene alone (or even with a gene encoding a Cas9 lacking nuclease activity) provided strong suggestive evidence for Cas9 toxicity when produced constitutively in C. reinhardtii. The present results provide compelling evidence that Cas9 and sgRNA genes function properly in C. reinhardtii to cause targeted gene modifications and point to the need for focus on development of methods to properly stem Cas9 production and/or activity following gene editing.},

Despite their importance, the signalling cascades that regulate cilium formation remain incompletely understood. Here we report that prostaglandin signalling affects ciliogenesis by regulating anterograde intraflagellar transport (IFT). Zebrafish leakytail (lkt) mutants show ciliogenesis defects, and the lkt locus encodes an ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCC4). We show that Lkt/ABCC4 localizes to the cell membrane and exports prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a function that is abrogated by the Lkt/ABCC4(T804M) mutant. PGE2 synthesis enzyme cyclooxygenase-1 and its receptor, EP4, which localizes to the cilium and activates the cyclic-AMP-mediated signalling cascade, are required for cilium formation and elongation. Importantly, PGE2 signalling increases anterograde but not retrograde velocity of IFT and promotes ciliogenesis in mammalian cells. These findings lead us to propose that Lkt/ABCC4-mediated PGE2 signalling acts through a ciliary G-protein-coupled receptor, EP4, to upregulate cAMP synthesis and increase anterograde IFT, thereby promoting ciliogenesis.},

At sites complementary to the crRNA-guide sequence, the Cas9 HNH nuclease domain cleaves the complementary strand, whereas the Cas9 RuvC-like domain cleaves the noncomplementary strand.

Nuclear mutants can be generated with ultraviolet (UV) light and chemical mutagens, or by insertional mutagenesis. Nuclear transformation methods include biolistic delivery, agitation with glass beads, and electroporation. Transforming DNA integrates into the genome at random sites, and multiple strategies exist for mapping insertion sites. A limited number of studies have demonstrated targeted modification of the nuclear genome by approaches such as zinc-finger nucleases and homologous recombination. RNA interference is widely used to knock down expression levels of nuclear genes. A wide assortment of transgenes has been successfully expressed in the Chlamydomonas nuclear genome, including transformation markers, fluorescent proteins, reporter genes, epitope tagged proteins, and even therapeutic proteins. Optimized expression constructs and strains help transgene expression. Emerging technologies such as the CRISPR/Cas9 system, high-throughput mutant identification, and a whole-genome knockout library are being developed for this organism. We discuss how these advances will propel future investigations.},

However, the precise mechanisms by which these cells mediate OE regeneration are unclear. Here, we show for the first time that the HBC subpopulation of basal stem cells uniquely possesses primary cilia that are aligned in an apical orientation in direct apposition to sustentacular cell end feet. The positioning of these cilia suggests that they function in the detection of growth signals and/or differentiation cues. To test this idea, we generated an inducible, cell type-specific Ift88 knock-out mouse line (K5rtTA;tetOCre;Ift88(fl/fl)) to disrupt cilia formation and maintenance specifically in HBCs. Surprisingly, the loss of HBC cilia did not affect the maintenance of the adult OE but dramatically impaired the regeneration of OSNs following lesion. Furthermore, the loss of cilia during development resulted in a region-specific decrease in neurogenesis, implicating HBCs in the establishment of the OE. Together, these results suggest a novel role for primary cilia in HBC activation, proliferation, and differentiation. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We show for the first time the presence of primary cilia on a quiescent population of basal stem cells, the horizontal basal cells (HBCs), in the olfactory epithelium (OE). Importantly, our data demonstrate that cilia on HBCs are necessary for regeneration of the OE following injury. Moreover, the disruption of HBC cilia alters neurogenesis during the development of the OE, providing evidence that HBCs participate in the establishment of this tissue. These data suggest that the mechanisms of penetrance for ciliopathies in the OE extend beyond that of defects in olfactory sensory neurons and may include alterations in OE maintenance and regeneration.},

  abstract = {The initiation of primary cilium assembly entails the docking of ciliary vesicles presumably derived from the Golgi complex to the distal end of the mother centriole. Distal appendages, which anchor the mother centriole to the plasma membrane, are thought to be involved in the docking process. However, little is known about the molecular players and mechanisms that mediate the vesicle-centriole association. Here we report that coiled-coil domain containing 41 (CCDC41) is required for the docking of ciliary vesicles. CCDC41 specifically localizes to the distal end of the mother centriole and interacts with centrosomal protein 164 (Cep164), a distal appendage component. In addition, a pool of CCDC41 colocalizes with intraflagellar transport protein 20 (IFT20) subunit of the intraflagellar transport particle at the Golgi complex. Remarkably, knockdown of CCDC41 inhibits the recruitment of IFT20 to the centrosome. Moreover, depletion of CCDC41 or IFT20 inhibits ciliogenesis at the ciliary vesicle docking step, whereas intraflagellar transport protein 88 (IFT88) depletion interferes with later cilium elongation steps. Our results suggest that CCDC41 collaborates with IFT20 to support the vesicle-centriole association at the onset of ciliogenesis.},

Here, we have measured the size of the nucleus in growing cells of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Analysis of mutant yeast strains spanning a range of cell sizes revealed that the ratio of average nuclear volume to average cell volume was quite consistent, with nuclear volume being approximately 7% that of cell volume. At the single cell level, nuclear and cell size were strongly correlated in growing wild-type cells, as determined by three different microscopic approaches. Even in G1-phase, nuclear volume grew, although it did not grow quite as fast as overall cell volume. DNA content did not appear to have any immediate, direct influence on nuclear size, in that nuclear size did not increase sharply during S-phase. The maintenance of nuclear size did not require continuous growth or ribosome biogenesis, as starvation and rapamycin treatment had little immediate impact on nuclear size. Blocking the nuclear export of new ribosomal subunits, among other proteins and RNAs, with leptomycin B also had no obvious effect on nuclear size. Nuclear expansion must now be factored into conceptual and mathematical models of budding yeast growth and division. These results raise questions as to the unknown force(s) that expand the nucleus as yeast cells grow.},

A cytoplasmic large T mutant that lacks sequences from around Lys-128 localizes to the nucleus if the missing sequence is attached to its amino terminus. The implication that the sequence element around Lys-128 acts as an autonomous signal capable of specifying nuclear location was tested directly by transferring it to the amino termini of beta-galactosidase and of pyruvate kinase, normally a cytoplasmic protein. Sequences that included the putative signal induced each of the fusion proteins to accumulate completely in the nucleus but had no discernible effect when Lys-128 was replaced by Thr. By reducing the size of the transposed sequence we conclude that Pro-Lys-Lys-Lys-Arg-Lys-Val can act as a nuclear location signal.

However, it has been unclear how PINK1 activates and recruits Parkin to mitochondria. Although PINK1 phosphorylates Parkin, other PINK1 substrates appear to activate Parkin, as the mutation of all serine and threonine residues conserved between Drosophila and human, including Parkin S65, did not wholly impair Parkin translocation to mitochondria. Using mass spectrometry, we discovered that endogenous PINK1 phosphorylated ubiquitin at serine 65, homologous to the site phosphorylated by PINK1 in Parkin’s ubiquitin-like domain. Recombinant TcPINK1 directly phosphorylated ubiquitin and phospho-ubiquitin activated Parkin E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in cell-free assays. In cells, the phosphomimetic ubiquitin mutant S65D bound and activated Parkin. Furthermore, expression of ubiquitin S65A, a mutant that cannot be phosphorylated by PINK1, inhibited Parkin translocation to damaged mitochondria. These results explain a feed-forward mechanism of PINK1-mediated initiation of Parkin E3 ligase activity.},

This study fabricates a three dimensional microelectrode using the 3D printing technique. The interdigitated microstructure consisting of poly lactic acid was injected by a 3D printer and coated with silver and aluminum with a series of dip-coatings. With the same strength of electric field (V cm(-1)), a higher efficiency for molecular delivery and a higher cellular viability are achieved with the microelectrode than with a standard cuvette. In addition, this study investigates chemicophysical changes such as Joule heating and dissolved metal during electroporation and showed the micro-electroporation system had less chemicophysical changes. It was concluded that the proposed micro-electroporation system will contribute to genetic engineering as a promising delivery tool, and this combination of 3D printing and electroporation has many potential applications for diverse designs or systems.},

  abstract = {The Escherichia coli bacteriophage P1 encodes a site-specific recombinase called Cre and two 34-bp target sites of Cre recombinase called loxP. The Cre/loxP system has been used to achieve targeted insertion and precise deletion in many animal and plant genomes. The Cre/loxP system has particularly been used for the removal of selectable marker genes to create marker-free transgenic organisms. For the first time, we applied the Cre/loxP-mediated site-specific recombination system to Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to construct marker-free transgenic strains. Specifically, C. reinhardtii strains cc4350 and cc124 carrying an aphVIII expression cassette flanked by two direct repeats of loxP were constructed. Separately, a synthetic Cre recombinase gene (CrCRE), the codons of which were optimized for expression in C. reinhardtii, was synthesized, and a CrCRE expression cassette was introduced into strain cc4350 carrying a single copy of the loxP-flanked aphVIII expression cassette. Among 46 transformants carrying the CrCRE expression cassette stably, the excision of aphVIII by CrCre recombinase was observed only in one transformant. We then constructed an expression cassette of an in-frame fusion of ble to CrCRE via a short linker peptide. The product of ble (Ble) is a bleomycin-binding protein that confers resistance to bleomycin-related antibiotics such as Zeocin and localizes in the nucleus. Therefore, the ble-(linker)-CrCRE fusion protein is expected to localize in the nucleus. When the ble-(linker)-CrCRE expression cassette was integrated into the genome of strain cc4350 carrying a single copy of the loxP-flanked aphVIII expression cassette, CrCre recombinase-mediated excision of the aphVIII expression cassette was observed at a frequency higher than that in stable transformants of the CrCRE expression cassette. Similarly, from strain cc124 carrying a single loxP-flanked aphVIII expression cassette, the aphVIII expression cassette was successfully excised after introduction of the ble-(linker)-CrCRE expression cassette. The ble-(linker)-CrCRE expression cassette remained in the genome after excision of the aphVIII expression cassette, and it was subsequently removed by crossing with the wild-type strain. This precise Cre-mediated deletion method applicable to transgenic C. reinhardtii could further increase the potential of this organism for use in basic and applied research.},

IFT is mediated by multisubunit complexes, including IFT-A, IFT-B, and the BBSome, in concert with kinesin and dynein motors. Under high salt conditions, purified IFT-B complex dissociates into a core subcomplex composed of at least nine subunits and at least five peripherally associated proteins. Using the visible immunoprecipitation assay, which we recently developed as a convenient protein-protein interaction assay, we determined the overall architecture of the IFT-B complex, which can be divided into core and peripheral subcomplexes composed of 10 and 6 subunits, respectively. In particular, we identified TTC26/IFT56 and Cluap1/IFT38, neither of which was included with certainty in previous models of the IFT-B complex, as integral components of the core and peripheral subcomplexes, respectively. Consistent with this, a ciliogenesis defect of Cluap1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts was rescued by exogenous expression of wild-type Cluap1 but not by mutant Cluap1 lacking the binding ability to other IFT-B components. The detailed interaction map as well as comparison of subcellular localization of IFT-B components between wild-type and Cluap1-deficient cells provides insights into the functional relevance of the architecture of the IFT-B complex.},

In this study, we show by sequence analysis that NAP is identical to a putative actin-related protein, the cDNA sequence of which has recently been reported and shown to have 64% amino acid identity with conventional actin. A polyclonal antibody raised against a synthetic polypeptide corresponding to the NH2-terminal sequence of this protein specifically reacted with the spot corresponding to NAP in two-dimensional electrophoresis patterns. NAP apparently can substitute for conventional actin in some, but not all, cellular functions, and therefore can be regarded as a highly divergent actin.

IFT particles are composed of about 20 proteins, and these proteins are highly conserved across ciliated species. IFT25, however, is absent from some ciliated organisms, suggesting that it may have a unique role distinct from ciliogenesis. Here, we generate an Ift25 null mouse and show that IFT25 is not required for ciliary assembly but is required for proper Hedgehog signaling, which in mammals occurs within cilia. Mutant mice die at birth with multiple phenotypes, indicative of Hedgehog signaling dysfunction. Cilia lacking IFT25 have defects in the signal-dependent transport of multiple Hedgehog components including Patched-1, Smoothened, and Gli2, and fail to activate the pathway upon stimulation. Thus, IFT function is not restricted to building cilia where signaling occurs, but also plays a separable role in signal transduction events.},

  abstract = {Removal of the flagella of Chlamydomonas results in increases in both flagellar protein synthesis and tubulin messenger RNA accumulation. These observations led us to examine whether flagellar protein gene sequences are transcribed differentially in nuclei isolated before and after deflagellation. A nuclear isolation protocol was developed using the cell wall-less strain of Chlamydomonas, CW 15, after cell lysis with 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Transcriptional activity of isolated nuclei was determined by incorporating [32P]UTP into TCA-precipitable and phenol-extractable RNA, and by hybridizing newly transcribed RNA to complementary DNA clones containing alpha- and beta-tubulin sequences. Nuclei from deflagellated cells are more active in transcribing sequences that hybridize with alpha- and beta-tubulin complementary DNA probes than are nuclei from nondeflagellated cells. In addition, while total [32P]UTP incorporation is inhibited 45% by alpha-amanitin concentrations of 1.0 micrograms/ml, tubulin RNA synthesis in this system is completely inhibited by this concentration of alpha-amanitin. This demonstration of differential transcription in nuclei before and after cell deflagellation provides the means to study in vitro the mechanisms that signal and regulate flagellar protein gene activity.},

  abstract = {Phyre2 is a suite of tools available on the web to predict and analyze protein structure, function and mutations. The focus of Phyre2 is to provide biologists with a simple and intuitive interface to state-of-the-art protein bioinformatics tools. Phyre2 replaces Phyre, the original version of the server for which we previously published a paper in Nature Protocols. In this updated protocol, we describe Phyre2, which uses advanced remote homology detection methods to build 3D models, predict ligand binding sites and analyze the effect of amino acid variants (e.g., nonsynonymous SNPs (nsSNPs)) for a user's protein sequence. Users are guided through results by a simple interface at a level of detail they determine. This protocol will guide users from submitting a protein sequence to interpreting the secondary and tertiary structure of their models, their domain composition and model quality. A range of additional available tools is described to find a protein structure in a genome, to submit large number of sequences at once and to automatically run weekly searches for proteins that are difficult to model. The server is available at http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2. A typical structure prediction will be returned between 30 min and 2 h after submission.},

  abstract = {Isoprenoids are a class of compounds derived from the five carbon precursors, dimethylallyl diphosphate, and isopentenyl diphosphate. These molecules present incredible natural chemical diversity, which can be valuable for humans in many aspects such as cosmetics, agriculture, and medicine. However, many terpenoids are only produced in small quantities by their natural hosts and can be difficult to generate synthetically. Therefore, much interest and effort has been directed toward capturing the genetic blueprint for their biochemistry and engineering it into alternative hosts such as plants and algae. These autotrophic organisms are attractive when compared to traditional microbial platforms because of their ability to utilize atmospheric CO2 as a carbon substrate instead of supplied carbon sources like glucose. This chapter will summarize important techniques and strategies for engineering the accumulation of isoprenoid metabolites into higher plants and algae by choosing the correct host, avoiding endogenous regulatory mechanisms, and optimizing potential flux into the target compound. Future endeavors will build on these efforts by fine-tuning product accumulation levels via the vast amount of available "-omic" data and devising metabolic engineering schemes that integrate this into a whole-organism approach. With the development of high-throughput transformation protocols and synthetic biology molecular tools, we have only begun to harness the power and utility of plant and algae metabolic engineering.},

Most strategies aimed at realizing this objective are based on genetically fusing the protein of interest to a reporter protein that monitors changes in the environment of the coupled protein. Examples include fusions with fluorescent proteins, the yeast two-hybrid system, and split ubiquitin. However, these techniques have various limitations, and considerable effort is being devoted to specific labeling of proteins in vivo with small synthetic molecules capable of probing and modulating their function. These approaches are currently based on the noncovalent binding of a small molecule to a protein, the formation of stable complexes between biarsenical compounds and peptides containing cysteines, or the use of biotin acceptor domains. Here we describe a general method for the covalent labeling of fusion proteins in vivo that complements existing methods for noncovalent labeling of proteins and that may open up new ways of studying proteins in living cells.},

Defective ciliary function causes ciliopathies such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). However, little is known about how large ciliary transmembrane proteins traffic to the cilia. Polycystin-1 (PC1) and -2 (PC2), the two ADPKD gene products, are large transmembrane proteins that co-localize to cilia where they act to control proper tubular diameter. Here we describe that PC1 and PC2 must interact and form a complex to reach the trans-Golgi network (TGN) for subsequent ciliary targeting. PC1 must also be proteolytically cleaved at a GPS site for this to occur. Using yeast two-hybrid screening coupled with a candidate approach, we identify a Rabep1/GGA1/Arl3-dependent ciliary targeting mechanism, whereby Rabep1 couples the polycystin complex to a GGA1/Arl3-based ciliary trafficking module at the TGN. This study provides novel insights into the ciliary trafficking mechanism of membrane proteins.},

RGEN RNPs cleave chromosomal DNA almost immediately after delivery and are degraded rapidly in cells, reducing off-target effects. Furthermore, RNP delivery is less stressful to human embryonic stem cells, producing at least twofold more colonies than does plasmid transfection.},

  abstract = {Algal lipids are the focus of intensive research because they are potential sources of biodiesel. However, most algae produce neutral lipids only under stress conditions. Here, we report that treatment with Brefeldin A (BFA), a chemical inducer of ER stress, rapidly triggers lipid droplet (LD) formation in two different microalgal species, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Chlorella vulgaris. LD staining using Nile red revealed that BFA-treated algal cells exhibited many more fluorescent bodies than control cells. Lipid analyses based on thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography revealed that the additional lipids formed upon BFA treatment were mainly triacylglycerols (TAGs). The increase in TAG accumulation was accompanied by a decrease in the betaine lipid diacylglyceryl N,N,N-trimethylhomoserine (DGTS), a major component of the extraplastidic membrane lipids in Chlamydomonas, suggesting that at least some of the TAGs were assembled from the degradation products of membrane lipids. Interestingly, BFA induced TAG accumulation in the Chlamydomonas cells regardless of the presence or absence of an acetate or nitrogen source in the medium. This effect of BFA in Chlamydomonas cells seems to be due to BFA-induced ER stress, as supported by the induction of three homologs of ER stress marker genes by the drug. Together, these results suggest that ER stress rapidly triggers TAG accumulation in two green microalgae, C. reinhardtii and C. vulgaris. A further investigation of the link between ER stress and TAG synthesis may yield an efficient means of producing biofuel from algae.},

  abstract = {Many proteins are known to promote ciliogenesis, but mechanisms that promote primary cilia disassembly before mitosis are largely unknown. Here we identify a mechanism that favours cilium disassembly and maintains the disassembled state. We show that co-localization of the S/G2 phase kinase, Nek2 and Kif24 triggers Kif24 phosphorylation, inhibiting cilia formation. We show that Kif24, a microtubule depolymerizing kinesin, is phosphorylated by Nek2, which stimulates its activity and prevents the outgrowth of cilia in proliferating cells, independent of Aurora A and HDAC6. Our data also suggest that cilium assembly and disassembly are in dynamic equilibrium, but Nek2 and Kif24 can shift the balance toward disassembly. Further, Nek2 and Kif24 are overexpressed in breast cancer cells, and ablation of these proteins restores ciliation in these cells, thereby reducing proliferation. Thus, Kif24 is a physiological substrate of Nek2, which regulates cilia disassembly through a concerted mechanism involving Kif24-mediated microtubule depolymerization.},

We establish that such oligomerization is essential for centriole formation in C. elegans and human cells. We further generate a structural model of the related protein Bld12p from C. reinhardtii, in which nine homodimers assemble into a ring from which nine coiled-coil rods radiate outward. Moreover, we demonstrate that recombinant Bld12p self-assembles into structures akin to the central hub of the cartwheel, which serves as a scaffold for centriole formation.

Existing strategies for reducing genome-wide off-target effects of the widely used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) are imperfect, possessing only partial or unproven efficacies and other limitations that constrain their use. Here we describe SpCas9-HF1, a high-fidelity variant harbouring alterations designed to reduce non-specific DNA contacts. SpCas9-HF1 retains on-target activities comparable to wild-type SpCas9 with >85% of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) tested in human cells. Notably, with sgRNAs targeted to standard non-repetitive sequences, SpCas9-HF1 rendered all or nearly all off-target events undetectable by genome-wide break capture and targeted sequencing methods. Even for atypical, repetitive target sites, the vast majority of off-target mutations induced by wild-type SpCas9 were not detected with SpCas9-HF1. With its exceptional precision, SpCas9-HF1 provides an alternative to wild-type SpCas9 for research and therapeutic applications. More broadly, our results suggest a general strategy for optimizing genome-wide specificities of other CRISPR-RNA-guided nucleases.},

  abstract = {Although CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases are widely used for genome editing, the range of sequences that Cas9 can recognize is constrained by the need for a specific protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). As a result, it can often be difficult to target double-stranded breaks (DSBs) with the precision that is necessary for various genome-editing applications. The ability to engineer Cas9 derivatives with purposefully altered PAM specificities would address this limitation. Here we show that the commonly used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) can be modified to recognize alternative PAM sequences using structural information, bacterial selection-based directed evolution, and combinatorial design. These altered PAM specificity variants enable robust editing of endogenous gene sites in zebrafish and human cells not currently targetable by wild-type SpCas9, and their genome-wide specificities are comparable to wild-type SpCas9 as judged by GUIDE-seq analysis. In addition, we identify and characterize another SpCas9 variant that exhibits improved specificity in human cells, possessing better discrimination against off-target sites with non-canonical NAG and NGA PAMs and/or mismatched spacers. We also find that two smaller-size Cas9 orthologues, Streptococcus thermophilus Cas9 (St1Cas9) and Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9), function efficiently in the bacterial selection systems and in human cells, suggesting that our engineering strategies could be extended to Cas9s from other species. Our findings provide broadly useful SpCas9 variants and, more importantly, establish the feasibility of engineering a wide range of Cas9s with altered and improved PAM specificities.},

Defects in primary cilia formation have been implicated in a number of genetic disorders, such as Bardet-Biedl Syndrome and Polycystic Kidney Disease. Recent studies have demonstrated that polarized vesicular transport involving Rab8 and its guanine nucleotide-exchange factor Rabin8 is essential for primary ciliogenesis. Here we report that Rabin8 is a direct downstream effector of Rab11, which functions in membrane trafficking from the trans-Golgi network and recycling endosomes. Rab11, in its GTP-bound form, interacts with Rabin8 and kinetically stimulates the guanine nucleotide-exchange activity of Rabin8 toward Rab8. Rab11 is enriched at the base of the primary cilia and inhibition of Rab11 function by a dominant-negative mutant or RNA interference blocks primary ciliogenesis. Our results suggest that Rab GTPases coordinate with each other in the regulation of vesicular trafficking during primary ciliogenesis.},

Kif24 preferentially localizes to mother centrioles. Loss of Kif24 from cycling cells resulted in aberrant cilia assembly but did not promote growth of abnormally long centrioles, unlike CP110 and Cep97 depletion. We found that loss of Kif24 leads to the disappearance of CP110 from mother centrioles, specifically in cycling cells able to form cilia. Kif24 is able to bind and depolymerize microtubules in vitro. Remarkably, ectopically expressed Kif24 specifically remodels centriolar microtubules without significantly altering cytoplasmic microtubules. Thus, our studies have identified a centriolar kinesin that specifically remodels a subset of microtubules, thereby regulating cilia assembly. These studies also suggest mechanistic differences between the regulation of microtubule elongation associated with centrioles and cilia.},

Here we report using immunofluorescent staining for the ciliary protein Arl13b that primary cilia are frequently found on HeLa (human epithelial adenocarcinoma) and other cancer cell lines such as MG63 (human osteosarcoma) commonly used for cell culture studies, and that the ciliated population is significantly higher (ave. 28.6% and 46.5%, respectively in starved and 15.7 to 18.6% in un-starved cells) than previously anticipated.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intrinsically unstructured proteins (IUPs) lack a well-defined three-dimensional structure. Some of them may assume a locally stable structure under specific conditions, e.g. upon interaction with another molecule, while others function in a permanently unstructured state. The discovery of IUPs challenged the traditional protein structure paradigm, which stated that a specific well-defined structure defines the function of the protein. As of December 2011, approximately 60 methods for computational prediction of protein disorder from sequence have been made publicly available. They are based on different approaches, such as utilizing evolutionary information, energy functions, and various statistical and machine learning methods. RESULTS: Given the diversity of existing intrinsic disorder prediction methods, we decided to test whether it is possible to combine them into a more accurate meta-prediction method. We developed a method based on arbitrarily chosen 13 disorder predictors, in which the final consensus was weighted by the accuracy of the methods. We have also developed a disorder predictor GSmetaDisorder3D that used no third-party disorder predictors, but alignments to known protein structures, reported by the protein fold-recognition methods, to infer the potentially structured and unstructured regions. Following the success of our disorder predictors in the CASP8 benchmark, we combined them into a meta-meta predictor called GSmetaDisorderMD, which was the top scoring method in the subsequent CASP9 benchmark. CONCLUSIONS: A series of disorder predictors described in this article is available as a MetaDisorder web server at http://iimcb.genesilico.pl/metadisorder/. Results are presented both in an easily interpretable, interactive mode and in a simple text format suitable for machine processing.},

The recombinant SBP domain of Crr1 shows zinc-dependent binding to functionally defined copper-response elements associated with the CYC6 and CPX1 promoters that contain a critical GTAC core sequence. Competition experiments indicate equivalent selectivity for copper-response elements from either promoter and 10-fold greater selectivity for the wild-type sequence vs. a sequence carrying a single mutation in the GTAC core. The SBP domain of Chlamydomonas Crr1 binds also to a related GTAC-containing sequence in the Arabidopsis AP1 promoter that is the binding site of a defining member of the SBP family of DNA-binding proteins. Chlamydomonas Crr1 is most similar to a subset of the Arabidopsis SBP domain proteins, which include SPL1, SPL7, and SPL12. The abundance of the CRR1 mRNA is only marginally copper-responsive, and although two mRNAs that differ with respect to splicing of the first intron are detected, there is no indication that the splicing event is regulated by metal nutrition or hypoxia. It is likely that the dramatic copper-responsive action of Crr1 occurs at the level of the polypeptide.},

  abstract = {At the completion of mitosis, the two daughter cells are connected by a channel of membrane-bound cytoplasm, the intercellular bridge. This structure contains parallel arrays of spindle microtubules which are associated, at the bridge midline, with a metallophilic band called the midbody. In an effort to characterize midbody components, intercellular bridges were partially purified. The purification consisted of brief sonication of telophase populations of mouse L929 cells in order to shear intercellular bridges from daughter cells, digestion of chromatin by an excess of micrococcal nuclease, and differential centrifugation to enrich for intercellular bridges. Electron microscopy of these preparations substantiated the identity of the bulk of material as intercellular bridges. After solubilization with sodium dodecyl sulfate, the protein components of these preparations were iodinated with Na(125)I and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. From these analyses, the major polypeptide components of intercellular bridges appear to be tubulin, varying amounts of plasma membrane proteins, and a polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 42,000. Time-course studies reveal that this polypeptide is first detectable in a pelletable form approximately 30 min after cells are released from metaphase block, reaches maximal spot intensity in late telophase, and is no longer detectable in G1 populations. We interpret these data to suggest that the 42,000-dalton polypeptide is a component of the midbody.},

  abstract = {Ciliary length control is an incompletely understood process essential for normal ciliary function. The flagella of Chlamydomonas mutants lacking multiple axonemal dyneins are shorter than normal; previously it was shown that this shortness can be suppressed by the mutation suppressor of shortness 1 (ssh1) via an unknown mechanism. To elucidate this mechanism, we carried out genetic analysis of ssh1 and found that it is a new allele of TPG2 (hereafter tpg2-3), which encodes FAP234 functioning in tubulin polyglutamylation in the axoneme. Similar to the polyglutamylation-deficient mutants tpg1 and tpg2-1, tpg2-3 axonemal tubulin has a greatly reduced level of long polyglutamate side chains. We found that tpg1 and tpg2-1 mutations also promote flagellar elongation in short-flagella mutants, consistent with a polyglutamylation-dependent mechanism of suppression. Double mutants of tpg1 or tpg2-1 and fla10-1, a temperature-sensitive mutant of intraflagellar transport, underwent slower flagellar shortening than fla10-1 at restrictive temperatures, indicating that the rate of tubulin disassembly is decreased in the polyglutamylation-deficient flagella. Moreover, alpha-tubulin incorporation into the flagellar tips in temporary dikaryons was retarded in polyglutamylation-deficient flagella. These results show that polyglutamylation deficiency stabilizes axonemal microtubules, decelerating axonemal disassembly at the flagellar tip and shifting the axonemal assembly/disassembly balance toward assembly.},

Immunoprecipitation and sucrose density gradient centrifugation experiments show that FAP234 and TTLL9 form a complex. The mutant tpg1 retains FAP234 in the cell body and flagellar matrix but lacks it in the axoneme. In contrast, tpg2 lacks both TTLL9 and FAP234 in all fractions. In fla10, a temperature-sensitive mutant deficient in intraflagellar transport (IFT), both TTLL9 and FAP234 are lost from the flagellum at nonpermissive temperatures.

Now, we have characterized the properties of the IP3 receptors channels present in the nuclei of the 1B5 cell line, which do not express any isoforms of the ryanodine receptor. Immunocytochemistry of isolated nuclei confirmed the presence of IP3R in the nuclear envelope and fluorescence measurements in nuclei suspensions allowed us to document ATP-dependent calcium loading by the nucleus and its release upon IP3 addition. Patch clamp of nuclear membranes was performed, and single-channel activity recorded was dependent on the presence of IP3 in the pipette; single-channel conductance was in the range reported in the literature for these channels, and the open probability was shown to be dependent on IP3 concentration. The presence of functional IP3 receptors in the nuclear envelope membrane is likely to have an important function in the regulation of nucleoplasmic calcium concentration and consequently in the regulation of transcription in muscle cells.},

Distinct isoforms of NKA are found in different tissues and subcellular localization patterns. For example, NKA alpha1 is widely expressed, NKA alpha3 is enriched in neurons, and NKA alpha4 is a testes specific isoform found in sperm flagella. In some tissues, ankyrin, a key component of the membrane cytoskeleton, can regulate the trafficking of NKA. In the retina, NKA and ankyrin-B are expressed in multiple cell types and immunostaining for each is striking in the synaptic layers. Labeling for NKA is also prominent along the inner segment plasma membrane of photoreceptors. NKA co-immunoprecipitates with ankyrin-B, but on a subcellular level co-localization of these two proteins varies dependent on the cell type. We used transgenic X. laevis tadpoles to evaluate the subcellular trafficking of NKA in photoreceptors. GFP-NKA alpha3 and alpha1 localized to the inner segment plasma membrane, but alpha4 localized to outer segments. We identified a VxP motif responsible for the outer segment targeting by using a series of chimeric and mutant NKA constructs. This motif is similar to previously identified ciliary targeting motifs. Given the structural similarities between outer segments and flagella, our findings shed light on the subcellular targeting of this testes specific NKA isoform.},

  abstract = {Mapping protein-protein interactions for chromatin-associated proteins remains challenging. Here we explore the use of BioID, a proximity biotinylation approach in which a mutated biotin ligase (BirA*) is fused to a bait of interest, allowing for the local activation of biotin and subsequent biotinylation of proteins in the bait vicinity. BioID allowed for successful interactome mapping of core histones and members of the mediator complex. We explored the background signal produced by the BioID approach and found that using distinct types of controls increased the stringency of our statistical analysis with SAINTexpress. A direct comparison of BioID with our AP-MS protocol optimized for chromatin-associated protein complexes revealed that the approaches identified few shared interaction partners and enriched for distinct biological processes; yet, both approaches permitted the recovery of biologically meaningful interactions. While no clear bias could be observed for either technique toward protein complexes of particular functions, BioID allowed for the purification of proteins of lower cellular abundance. Finally, we were able to identify a strong association of MED4 with the centrosome by BioID and validated this finding by immunofluorescence. In summary, BioID complements AP-MS for the study of chromatin-associated protein complexes. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This manuscript describes the application of BioID, a proximity biotinylation approach, to chromatin-associated proteins, namely core histones and members of the mediator complex. We observed that BioID was successful at identifying known interaction partners for the baits tested, but also allowed novel putative interaction partners to be identified. By performing a detailed comparison of BioID versus a standard method for interactome mapping (affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry, AP-MS), we show that the approaches were complementary, allowing for purification of different interaction partners. These interaction partners were different in the biological processes they are associated with, but also in their abundance. BioID represents a significant technical development in the field of chromatin research by expanding the search space for interactome mapping beyond what is possible with AP-MS.

  abstract = {Genome editing by CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 (CRISPR-associated gene 9) system has been transformative in biology. Originally discovered as an adaptive prokaryotic immune system, CRISPR/Cas9 has been repurposed for genome editing in a broad range of model organisms, from yeast to mammalian cells. Protist parasites are unicellular organisms producing important human diseases that affect millions of people around the world. For many of these diseases, such as malaria, Chagas disease, leishmaniasis and cryptosporidiosis, there are no effective treatments or vaccines available. The recent adaptation of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to several protist models will be playing a key role in the functional study of their proteins, in the characterization of their metabolic pathways, and in the understanding of their biology, and will facilitate the search for new chemotherapeutic targets. In this work we review recent studies where the CRISPR/Cas9 system was adapted to protist parasites, particularly to Apicomplexans and trypanosomatids, emphasizing the different molecular strategies used for genome editing of each organism, as well as their advantages. We also discuss the potential usefulness of this technology in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.},

  abstract = {Microalgae are diverse photosynthetic microbes which offer the potential for production of a number of high value products (HVP) such as pigments, oils, and bio-active compounds. Fast growth rates, ease of photo-autotrophic cultivation, unique metabolic properties and continuing progress in algal transgenics have raised interest in the use of microalgae systems for recombinant protein (RP) production. This work demonstrates the development of an advanced RP production and secretion system for the green unicellular model alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We generated a versatile expression vector that employs the secretion signal of the native extracellular C. reinhardtii carbonic anhydrase for efficient RP secretion into the culture medium. Unique restriction sites were placed between the regulatory elements to allow fast and easy sub-cloning of sequences of interest. Positive transformants can rapidly be identified by high-throughput plate-level screens via a coupled Gaussia luciferase marker. The vector was tested in Chlamydomonas wild type CC-1883 (WT) and in the transgene expression transformant UVM4. Compared to the native secretion signal of the Gaussia luciferase, up to 84% higher RP production could be achieved. With this new expression system we could generate transformants that express up to 10 mg RP per liter culture without further optimization. The target RP is found exclusively in culture medium and can therefore easily be isolated and purified. We conclude that this new expression system will be a valuable tool for many heterologous protein expression applications from C. reinhardtii in the future.},

The vector was designed in a modular fashion which allows quick replacement of regulatory elements and genes of interest. The current toolkit comprises two antibiotic resistance markers (paromomycin and hygromycin B), five codon-optimized light emission reporters, including the Gaussia princeps luciferase, as well as bright cyan, green, yellow, and red fluorescent protein variants. The system has demonstrated robust functional flexibility with signal options to target the protein of interest to the cytoplasm, the nucleus, cellular microbodies, the chloroplast, mitochondria, or via the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi apparatus secretory pathway into the culture medium. Successful fluorescent reporter protein fusion to C. reinhardtii Rubisco small subunit 1 was accomplished with this system. Localization of the fluorescently tagged protein was observed in the chloroplast pyrenoid via live cell fluorescence microscopy, the first report of heterologous protein localization to this cellular structure. The functionalities of the vector toolkit, the individual modular elements, as well as several combinations thereof are demonstrated in this manuscript. Due to its strategic design, this vector system can quickly be adapted to individual tasks and should therefore be of great use to address specific scientific questions requiring nuclear recombinant protein expression in C. reinhardtii.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most motile cilia and flagella have nine outer doublet and two central pair (CP) microtubules. Outer doublet microtubules are continuous with the triplet microtubules of the basal body, are templated by the basal body microtubules, and grow by addition of new subunits to their distal ("plus") ends. In contrast, CP microtubules are not continuous with basal body microtubules, raising the question of how these microtubules are assembled and how their polarity is established. METHODS: CP assembly in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was analyzed by electron microscopy and wide-field and super-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy. To analyze CP assembly independently from flagellar assembly, the CP-deficient katanin mutants pf15 or pf19 were mated to wild-type cells. HA-tagged tubulin and the CP-specific protein hydin were used as markers to analyze de novo CP assembly inside the formerly mutant flagella. RESULTS: In regenerating flagella, the CP and its projections assemble near the transition zone soon after the onset of outer doublet elongation. During de novo CP assembly in full-length flagella, the nascent CP was first apparent in a subdistal region of the flagellum. The developing CP replaces a fibrous core that fills the axonemal lumen of CP-deficient flagella. The fibrous core contains proteins normally associated with the C1 CP microtubule and proteins involved in intraflagellar transport (IFT). In flagella of the radial spoke-deficient mutant pf14, two pairs of CPs are frequently present with identical correct polarities. CONCLUSIONS: The temporal separation of flagellar and CP assembly in dikaryons formed by mating CP-deficient gametes to wild-type gametes revealed that the formation of the CP does not require proximity to the basal body or transition zone, or to the flagellar tip. The observations on pf14 provide further support that the CP self-assembles without a template and eliminate the possibility that CP polarity is established by interaction with axonemal radial spokes. Polarity of the developing CP may be determined by the proximal-to-distal gradient of precursor molecules. IFT proteins accumulate in flagella of CP mutants; the abnormal distribution of IFT proteins may explain why these flagella are often shorter than normal.},

Ciliary defects are associated with several human diseases, including polycystic kidney disease, primary ciliary dyskinesia, left-right axis patterning, hydrocephalus and retinal degeneration. However, the genetic and cellular biological control of ciliogenesis remains poorly understood. The IFT46 is one of the highly conserved intraflagellar transport complex B proteins. In zebrafish, ift46 is expressed in various ciliated tissues such as Kupffers vesicle, pronephric ducts, ears and spinal cord. We show that ift46 is localized to the basal body. Knockdown of ift46 gene results in multiple phenotypes associated with various ciliopathies including kidney cysts, pericardial edema and ventral axis curvature. In ift46 morphants, cilia in kidney and spinal canal are shortened and abnormal. Similar ciliary defects are observed in otic vesicles, lateral line hair cells, olfactory pits, but not in Kupffers vesicle. To explore the functions of Ift46 during mouse development, we have generated Ift46 knock-out mice. The Ift46 mutants have developmental defects in brain, neural tube and heart. In particular Ift46(-/-) homozygotes displays randomization of the embryo heart looping, which is a hallmark of defective left-right (L/R) axis patterning. Taken together, our results demonstrated that IFT46 has an essential role in vertebrate ciliary development.},

  abstract = {Synthesis of new proteins is required to regenerate full length Chlamydomonas flagella after deflagellation. Using gametes, which have a low basal level of protein synthesis, it has been possible to label and detect the synthesis of many flagellar proteins in whole cells. The deflagellation-induced synthesis of the tubulins, dyneins, the flagellar membrane protein, and at least 20 other proteins which co-migrate with proteins in isolated axonemes, can be detected in gamete cytoplasm, and the times of initiation and termination of synthesis for each of the proteins can be studied. The nature of the signal that stimulates the cell to initiate flagellar protein synthesis is unknown. Flagellar regeneration and accompanying pool depletion are not necessary for either the onset or termination of flagellar protein synthesis, because colchicine, which blocks flagellar regeneration, does not change the pattern of proteins synthesized in the cytoplasm after deflagellation or the timing of their synthesis. Moreover, flagellar protein synthesis is stimulated after cells are chemically induced to resorb their flagella, indicating that the act of deflagellation itself is not necessary to stimulate synthesis. Methods were defined for inducing the cells to resorb their flagella by removing Ca++ from the medium and raising the concentration of K+ or Na+. The resorption was reversible and the flagellar components that were resorbed could be re-utilized to assemble flagella in the absence of protein synthesis. This new technique is used in this report to study the control of synthesis and assembly of flagella.},

  abstract = {At the end of cell division, cytokinesis splits the cytoplasm of nascent daughter cells and partitions segregated sister genomes. To coordinate cell division with chromosome segregation, the mitotic spindle controls cytokinetic events at the cell envelope. The spindle midzone stimulates the actomyosin-driven contraction of the cleavage furrow, which proceeds until the formation of a microtubule-rich intercellular bridge with the midbody at its centre. The midbody directs the final membrane abscission reaction and has been proposed to attach the cleavage furrow to the intercellular bridge. How the mitotic spindle is connected to the plasma membrane during cytokinesis is not understood. Here we identify a plasma membrane tethering activity in the centralspindlin protein complex, a conserved component of the spindle midzone and midbody. We demonstrate that the C1 domain of the centralspindlin subunit MgcRacGAP associates with the plasma membrane by interacting with polyanionic phosphoinositide lipids. Using X-ray crystallography we determine the structure of this atypical C1 domain. Mutations in the hydrophobic cap and in basic residues of the C1 domain of MgcRacGAP prevent association of the protein with the plasma membrane, and abrogate cytokinesis in human and chicken cells. Artificial membrane tethering of centralspindlin restores cell division in the absence of the C1 domain of MgcRacGAP. Although C1 domain function is dispensable for the formation of the midzone and midbody, it promotes contractility and is required for the attachment of the plasma membrane to the midbody, a long-postulated function of this organelle. Our analysis suggests that centralspindlin links the mitotic spindle to the plasma membrane to secure the final cut during cytokinesis in animal cells.},

  abstract = {Biotin-dependent enzymes play an essential role in the metabolism of all organisms. Their biotinylation is catalyzed by holoenzyme synthetases, which attach a biotin molecule to a specific lysine residue on the apoenzymes. The sequence flanking the biotin binding site is highly conserved among biotin-dependent enzymes. This sequence conservation might be related to the extensive cross-species activity showed by holoenzyme synthetases. In this study, we have expressed carboxyl-terminal fragments of the alpha subunit of human propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC-alpha) in Escherichia coli and used site-directed mutagenesis to determine the sequence requirements for biotinylation by the bacterial holoenzyme synthetase. We show that the carboxyl-terminal 67 amino acids of PCC-alpha act as an independent domain in the biotinylation reaction. Mutations that affect several conserved Gly residues and a Pro-Met-Pro sequence near the biotin binding site are critical for biotinylation. Substitution of the amino acids that flank the biotin acceptor Lys residue or elimination of the last 3 amino acids of the PCC-alpha peptides had little or no effect on their biotinylation despite their high conservation in biotin enzymes.},

  abstract = {Classical protein import, mediated by the binding of a classical nuclear localization signal (NLS) to the NLS receptor, karyopherin/importin alpha, is the most well studied nuclear transport process. Classical NLSs are either monopartite sequences that contain a single cluster of basic amino acids (Lys/Arg) or bipartite sequences that contain two clusters of basic residues separated by an unconserved linker region. We have created mutations in conserved residues in each of the three NLS-binding sites/regions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae karyopherin alpha (SRP1). For each mutant we have analyzed binding to both a monopartite and a bipartite NLS cargo in vitro. We have also expressed each karyopherin alpha mutant in vivo as the only cellular copy of the NLS receptor and examined the impact on cell growth and import of both monopartite and bipartite NLS-containing cargoes. Our results reveal the functional significance of specific residues within karyopherin alpha for NLS cargo binding. A karyopherin alpha variant with a mutation in the major NLS-binding site exhibits decreased binding to both monopartite and bipartite NLS cargoes, and this protein is not functional in vivo. However, we also find that a karyopherin alpha variant with a mutation in the minor NLS-binding site, which shows decreased binding only to bipartite NLS-containing cargoes, is also not functional in vivo. This suggests that the cell is dependent on the function of at least one bipartite NLS cargo that is imported into the nucleus by karyopherin alpha. Our experiments also reveal functional importance for the linker-binding region. This study provides insight into how changes in binding to cellular NLS sequences could impact cellular function. In addition, this work has led to the creation of conditional alleles of karyopherin alpha with well characterized defects in NLS binding that will be useful for identifying and characterizing novel NLS cargoes.},

  abstract = {The green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a leading unicellular model for dissecting biological processes in photosynthetic eukaryotes. However, its usefulness has been limited by difficulties in obtaining mutants in specific genes of interest. To allow generation of large numbers of mapped mutants, we developed high-throughput methods that (1) enable easy maintenance of tens of thousands of Chlamydomonas strains by propagation on agar media and by cryogenic storage, (2) identify mutagenic insertion sites and physical coordinates in these collections, and (3) validate the insertion sites in pools of mutants by obtaining >500 bp of flanking genomic sequences. We used these approaches to construct a stably maintained library of 1935 mapped mutants, representing disruptions in 1562 genes. We further characterized randomly selected mutants and found that 33 out of 44 insertion sites (75%) could be confirmed by PCR, and 17 out of 23 mutants (74%) contained a single insertion. To demonstrate the power of this library for elucidating biological processes, we analyzed the lipid content of mutants disrupted in genes encoding proteins of the algal lipid droplet proteome. This study revealed a central role of the long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase LCS2 in the production of triacylglycerol from de novo-synthesized fatty acids.},

To date, a serious knowledge gap remains in our understanding of DNA repair mechanisms in human early embryos, and in the efficiency and potential off-target effects of using technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 in human pre-implantation embryos. In this report, we used tripronuclear (3PN) zygotes to further investigate CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in human cells. We found that CRISPR/Cas9 could effectively cleave the endogenous beta-globin gene (HBB). However, the efficiency of homologous recombination directed repair (HDR) of HBB was low and the edited embryos were mosaic. Off-target cleavage was also apparent in these 3PN zygotes as revealed by the T7E1 assay and whole-exome sequencing. Furthermore, the endogenous delta-globin gene (HBD), which is homologous to HBB, competed with exogenous donor oligos to act as the repair template, leading to untoward mutations. Our data also indicated that repair of the HBB locus in these embryos occurred preferentially through the non-crossover HDR pathway. Taken together, our work highlights the pressing need to further improve the fidelity and specificity of the CRISPR/Cas9 platform, a prerequisite for any clinical applications of CRSIPR/Cas9-mediated editing.},

At the cellular level, many proteins form nuclear foci known as nuclear bodies in which many components interact with each other. Photobodies are nuclear bodies containing proteins for light-signaling pathways in plants. What initiates the formation of photobodies is poorly understood. Here we develop a nucleolar marker protein nucleolin2 (Nuc2)-based method called the nucleolus-tethering system (NoTS) by artificially tethering a protein of interest to the nucleolus to analyze the initiation of photobodies. A candidate initiator is evaluated by visualizing whether a protein fused with Nuc2 forms body-like structures at the periphery of the nucleolus, and other components are recruited to the de novo-formed bodies. The interaction between two proteins can also be revealed through relocation and recruitment of interacting proteins to the nucleolus. Using the NoTS, we test the interactions among components in photobodies. In addition, we demonstrate that components of photobodies such as CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1, photoreceptors, and transcription factors tethered to the nucleolus have the capacity to form body-like structures at the periphery of the nucleolus, which contain other components of photobodies, suggesting a self-organization model for the biogenesis of photobodies.},

Each monomer is an eight-stranded antiparallel beta-barrel, remarkably similar to that of the genetically distinct bacterial analog streptavidin. As in streptavidin, binding of biotin involves a highly stabilized network of polar and hydrophobic interactions. There are, however, some differences. The presence of additional hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups in the binding site of avidin (which are missing in streptavidin) may account for its higher affinity constant. Two amino acid substitutions are proposed to be responsible for its susceptibility to denaturation relative to streptavidin. Unexpectedly, a residual N-acetylglucosamine moiety was detected in the deglycosylated avidin monomer by difference Fourier synthesis.},

How the Rab GTPase Rab11-Rab8 cascade functions in early ciliary membrane assembly is unknown.

EHD1 and EHD3 localize to preciliary membranes and the ciliary pocket. EHD-dependent membrane tubulation is essential for ciliary vesicle formation from smaller distal appendage vesicles (DAVs). Importantly, this step functions in M-centriole to basal body transformation and recruitment of transition zone proteins and IFT20. SNAP29, a SNARE membrane fusion regulator and EHD1-binding protein, is also required for DAV-mediated ciliary vesicle assembly.

  abstract = {Required for the assembly and maintenance of eukaryotic cilia and flagella, intraflagellar transport (IFT) consists of the bidirectional movement of large protein particles between the base and the distal tip of the organelle. Anterograde movement of particles away from the cell body is mediated by kinesin-2, whereas retrograde movement away from the flagellar tip is powered by cytoplasmic dynein 1b/2. IFT particles contain multiple copies of two distinct protein complexes, A and B, which contain at least 6 and 11 protein subunits, respectively. In this study, we have used increased ionic strength to remove four peripheral subunits from the IFT complex B of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, revealing a 500-kDa core that contains IFT88, IFT81, IFT74/72, IFT52, IFT46, and IFT27. This result demonstrates that the complex B subunits, IFT172, IFT80, IFT57, and IFT20 are not required for the core subunits to stay associated. Chemical cross-linking of the complex B core resulted in multiple IFT81-74/72 products. Yeast-based two-hybrid and three-hybrid analyses were then used to show that IFT81 and IFT74/72 directly interact to form a higher order oligomer consistent with a tetrameric complex. Similar analysis of the vertebrate IFT81 and IFT74/72 homologues revealed that this interaction has been evolutionarily conserved. We hypothesize that these proteins form a tetrameric complex, (IFT81)2(IFT74/72)2, which serves as a scaffold for the formation of the intact IFT complex B.},

  abstract = {How cells control organelle size is an elusive problem. Two predominant models for size control can be distinguished: (1) induced control, where organelle genesis, maintenance, and disassembly are three separate programs that are activated in response to size change, and (2) constitutive control, where stable size results from the balance between continuous organelle assembly and disassembly. The problem has been studied in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii because the flagella are easy to measure, their size changes only in the length dimension, and the genetics are comparable to yeast. Length dynamics in Chlamydomonas flagella are quite robust: they maintain a length of about 12 mum and recover from amputation in about 90 min with a growth rate that decreases smoothly to zero as the length approaches 12 mum. Despite a wealth of experimental studies, existing data are consistent with both induced and constitutive control models for flagella. Here we developed novel microfluidic trapping and laser microsurgery techniques in Chlamydomonas to distinguish between length control models by measuring the two flagella on a single cell as they equilibrate after amputation of a single flagellum. The results suggest that cells equalize flagellar length by constitutive control.},

Toward this end, rapid advances have recently been made in our understanding of mechanisms for DNA stability and transport within cells. Current synthetic DNA delivery systems are versatile and safe, but substantially less efficient than viruses. Indeed, most current systems address only one of the obstacles to DNA delivery by enhancing DNA uptake. In fact, the effectiveness of gene expression is also dependent on several additional factors, including the release of intracellular DNA, stability of DNA in the cytoplasm, unpackaging of the DNA-vector complex, and the targeting of DNA to the nucleus. Delivery systems of the future must fully accommodate all these processes to effectively shepherd DNA across the plasma membrane, through the hostile intracellular environment, and into the nucleus.},

  abstract = {The cilium both releases and binds to extracellular vesicles (EVs) (Hogan et al., 2009; Pampliega et al., 2013; Wood et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014). EVs may be used by cells as a form of intercellular communication and mediate a broad range of physiological and pathological processes (Gyorgy et al., 2011). The mammalian polycystins (PCs) localize to cilia as well as urinary EVs released from renal epithelial cells (Hogan et al., 2009). PC ciliary trafficking defects may be an underlying cause of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (Cai et al., 2014), and ciliary-EV interactions have been proposed to play a central role in the biology of PKD (Chacon-Heszele et al., 2014). In C. elegans and mammals, PC1 and PC2 act in the same genetic pathway, act in a sensory capacity, localize to cilia, and are contained in secreted EVs, suggesting ancient conservation (Hogan et al., 2009; O’Hagan et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014). However, the relationship between cilia and EVs and the mechanisms generating PC-containing EVs remain an enigma. In a forward genetic screen for regulators of C. elegans PKD-2 ciliary localization (Bae et al., 2008), we identified CIL-7, a myristoylated protein that regulates EV biogenesis. Loss of CIL-7 results in male mating behavioral defects, excessive accumulation of EVs in the lumen of the cephalic sensory organ, and failure to release PKD-2::GFP-containing EVs to the environment. Fatty acylation, such as myristoylation and palmitoylation, targets proteins to cilia and flagella (Godsel and Engman, 1999; Ramulu and Nathans, 2001; Tao et al., 2009; Tull et al., 2010; Maric et al., 2011; Wright et al., 2011; Cevik et al., 2013). The CIL-7 myristoylation motif is essential for CIL-7 function and for targeting CIL-7 to EVs. C. elegans is a powerful model to study ciliary EV biogenesis in vivo and to identify cis-targeting motifs such as myristoylation that are necessary for EV-cargo association and function.},

Using this functionality we developed a transcriptional activation-based assay to determine the landscape of off-target binding of sgRNA:Cas9 complexes and compared it with the off-target activity of transcription activator-like (TALs) effectors. Our results reveal that specificity profiles are sgRNA dependent, and that sgRNA:Cas9 complexes and 18-mer TAL effectors can potentially tolerate 1-3 and 1-2 target mismatches, respectively. By engineering a requirement for cooperativity through offset nicking for genome editing or through multiple synergistic sgRNAs for robust transcriptional activation, we suggest methods to mitigate off-target phenomena. Our results expand the versatility of the sgRNA:Cas9 tool and highlight the critical need to engineer improved specificity.},

Mechanisms that are discussed below facilitate ciliary localization of structural and signaling molecules, which include receptors, G-proteins, ion channels, and enzymes. These mechanisms form a basis for every aspect of cilia function in early embryonic patterning, organ morphogenesis, sensory perception and elsewhere.},

  abstract = {Flagellar length regulation provides a simple model system for addressing the general problem of organelle size control. Based on a systems-level analysis of flagellar dynamics, we have proposed a mechanism for flagellar length control in which length is set by the balance of continuous flagellar assembly and disassembly. The model proposes that the assembly rate is length dependent due to the inherent length dependence of intraflagellar transport, whereas disassembly is length independent, such that the two rates can only reach a balance point at a single length. In this report, we test this theoretical model by using three different measurements: 1) the quantity of intraflagellar transport machinery as a function of length, 2) the variation of flagellar length as a function of flagellar number, and 3) the rate of flagellar growth as a function of length. We find that the quantity of intraflagellar transport machinery is independent of length, that flagellar length is a decreasing function of flagellar number, and that flagellar growth rate in regenerating flagella depends on length and not on the time since regeneration began. These results are consistent with the balance-point model for length control. The three strategies used here are not limited to flagella and can in principle be adapted to probe size control systems for any organelle.},

  abstract = {Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a unicellular eukaryotic alga possessing a single chloroplast that is widely used as a model system for the study of photosynthetic processes. This report analyzes the surprising structural and evolutionary features of the completely sequenced 203,395-bp plastid chromosome. The genome is divided by 21.2-kb inverted repeats into two single-copy regions of approximately 80 kb and contains only 99 genes, including a full complement of tRNAs and atypical genes encoding the RNA polymerase. A remarkable feature is that >20% of the genome is repetitive DNA: the majority of intergenic regions consist of numerous classes of short dispersed repeats (SDRs), which may have structural or evolutionary significance. Among other sequenced chlorophyte plastid genomes, only that of the green alga Chlorella vulgaris appears to share this feature. The program MultiPipMaker was used to compare the genic complement of Chlamydomonas with those of other chloroplast genomes and to scan the genomes for sequence similarities and repetitive DNAs. Among the results was evidence that the SDRs were not derived from extant coding sequences, although some SDRs may have arisen from other genomic fragments. Phylogenetic reconstruction of changes in plastid genome content revealed that an accelerated rate of gene loss also characterized the Chlamydomonas/Chlorella lineage, a phenomenon that might be independent of the proliferation of SDRs. Together, our results reveal a dynamic and unusual plastid genome whose existence in a model organism will allow its features to be tested functionally.},

  abstract = {Vertebrate cells can initiate ciliogenesis from centrioles at the cell center, near the Golgi, forming primary cilia confined or submerged in a deep narrow pit created by membrane invagination. How or why cells maintain submerged cilia is unclear. Here, by characterizing centriole subdistal appendages (sDAP) in cells exclusively growing submerged cilia, we found that a group of sDAP components localize to the centriole proximal end through the cohesion factor C-Nap1 and that sDAP function redundantly with C-Nap1 for submerged cilia maintenance. Loss of sDAP and C-Nap1 has no effect on cilia assembly, but it disrupts stable Golgi-cilia association and allows normally submerged cilia to fully surface, losing the deep membrane invagination. Intriguingly, unlike submerged cilia (stationary), surfaced cilia actively respond to mechanical stimuli with motions and can ectopically recruit Hedgehog signaling components in the absence of agonist. We propose that spatial control of ciliogenesis uncouples or specifies sensory properties of cilia.},

  abstract = {Cilia are evolutionarily conserved organelles found on many mammalian cell types, including neuronal populations. Although neuronal cilia, including those on olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), are often delineated by localization of adenylyl cyclase 3 (AC3, also known as ADCY3), the mechanisms responsible for targeting integral membrane proteins are largely unknown. Post-translational modification by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins plays an important role in protein localization processes such as nuclear-cytosolic transport. Here, we identified through bioinformatic analysis that adenylyl cyclases harbor conserved SUMOylation motifs, and show that AC3 is a substrate for SUMO modification. Functionally, overexpression of the SUMO protease SENP2 prevented ciliary localization of AC3, without affecting ciliation or cilia maintenance. Furthermore, AC3-SUMO mutants did not localize to cilia. To test whether SUMOylation is sufficient for cilia entry, we compared localization of ANO2, which possesses a SUMO motif, and ANO1, which lacks SUMOylation sites and does not localize to cilia. Introduction of SUMOylation sites into ANO1 was not sufficient for ciliary entry. These data suggest that SUMOylation is necessary but not sufficient for ciliary trafficking of select constituents, further establishing the link between ciliary and nuclear import.},

Their use in mammalian cell requires expression of the bacterial biotinylation enzyme BirA.

  abstract = {Mytichitin-A is an antimicrobial peptide isolated from the serum of Mytilus coruscus and is reported to inhibit bacterial growth as tested on several Gram-positive bacteria. To produce large quantity of Mytichitin-A to further investigate its biological activity, nucleotide sequence encoding a recombinant 6 x His-Mytichitin-A (rMytichitin-A) peptide was synthesized and inserted into the inducible yeast expression vector pPICZalphaA. With the availability of such an expression vector called pPICZalphaA-Mytichitin-A, we transformed Pichia pastoris GS115 cells with a SacI-linearized pPICZalphaA-Mytichitin-A by electroporation. Transgenic strains secreting rMytichitin-A with a molecular weight of approximate 10 KDa as expected were obtained. The optimal culture condition for rMytichitin-A expression was determined to be 1.0% methanol induction, 96 h incubation at 28 degrees C and the amount of rMytichitin-A reached 45.5 mug/ml. The percentage of rMytichitin-A was estimated to be 73.6% of the total protein. After rMytichitin-A was purified using nickel ions affinity chromatography, approximate 9.1 mg pure rMytichitin-A was obtained from 500 ml of cell culture medium with 97.8% purity. More importantly, both the culture supernatant and purified rMytichitin-A inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria, especially Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis with a minimum inhibition concentration of as low as 31 and 48 mug/ml, respectively. Differently from the native protein, however, the rMytichitin-A is not active against Gram-negative bacteria. Taken together, this is the first report on the heterologous expression of Mytichitin-A in P. pastoris. Our study showed that P. pastoris is an effective expression system for producing large quantities of biologically active Mytichitin-A for both research and application purposes.},

Coordinated ciliary beating in MCCs contributes to fluid propulsion in several biological processes.

Recently, we have shown that miR-34/449 also modulate small GTPase pathways to promote, in a later stage of differentiation, the assembly of the apical actin network, a prerequisite for proper anchoring of centrioles-derived neo-synthesized basal bodies. We characterized several miR-34/449 targets related to small GTPase pathways including R-Ras, which represents a key and conserved regulator during MCC differentiation. Direct RRAS repression by miR-34/449 is necessary for apical actin meshwork assembly, notably by allowing the apical relocalization of the actin binding protein Filamin-A near basal bodies. Our studies establish miR-34/449 as central players that orchestrate several steps of MCC differentiation program by regulating distinct signaling pathways.},

  abstract = {Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) employ a cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel to generate a receptor current in response to an odorant-induced rise in cAMP. This channel contains three types of subunits, the principal CNGA2 subunit and two modulatory subunits (CNGA4 and CNGB1b). Here, we have analyzed the functional relevance of CNGB1 for olfaction by gene targeting in mice. Electro-olfactogram responses of CNGB1-deficient (CNGB1-/-) mice displayed a reduced maximal amplitude and decelerated onset and recovery kinetics compared with wild-type mice. In a behavioral test, CNGB1-/- mice exhibited a profoundly decreased olfactory performance. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that ORNs of CNGB1-/- mice weakly expressed a CNG current with decreased cAMP sensitivity, very rapid flicker-gating behavior and no fast modulation by Ca2+-calmodulin. Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed the presence of a CNGA2/CNGA4 channel in the olfactory epithelium of CNGB1-/- mice. This CNGA2/CNGA4 channel was targeted to the plasma membrane of olfactory knobs, but failed to be trafficked into olfactory cilia. Interestingly, we observed a similar trafficking defect in mice deficient for the CNGA4 subunit. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that CNGB1 has a dual function in vivo. First, it endows the olfactory CNG channel with a variety of biophysical properties tailored to the specific requirements of olfactory transduction. Second, together with the CNGA4 subunit, CNGB1 is needed for ciliary targeting of the olfactory CNG channel.},

We present a method that readily captures rapid snapshots of the ciliary proteome by selectively biotinylating ciliary proteins using a cilia-targeted proximity labeling enzyme (cilia-APEX). Besides identifying known ciliary proteins, cilia-APEX uncovered several ciliary signaling molecules. The kinases PKA, AMPK, and LKB1 were validated as bona fide ciliary proteins and PKA was found to regulate Hedgehog signaling in primary cilia. Furthermore, proteomics profiling of Ift27/Bbs19 mutant cilia correctly detected BBSome accumulation inside Ift27(-/-) cilia and revealed that beta-arrestin 2 and the viral receptor CAR are candidate cargoes of the BBSome. This work demonstrates that proximity labeling can be applied to proteomics of non-membrane-enclosed organelles and suggests that proteomics profiling of cilia will enable a rapid and powerful characterization of ciliopathies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The large amount of data that are currently produced in the biological sciences can no longer be explored and visualized efficiently with traditional, specialized software. Instead, new capabilities are needed that offer flexibility, rapid application development and deployment as standalone applications or available through the Web. RESULTS: We describe a new software toolkit--the Molecular Biology Toolkit (MBT; http://mbt.sdsc.edu)--that enables fast development of applications for protein analysis and visualization. The toolkit is written in Java, thus offering platform-independence and Internet delivery capabilities. Several applications of the toolkit are introduced to illustrate the functionality that can be achieved. CONCLUSIONS: The MBT provides a well-organized assortment of core classes that provide a uniform data model for the description of biological structures and automate most common tasks associated with the development of applications in the molecular sciences (data loading, derivation of typical structural information, visualization of sequence and standard structural entities).},

  abstract = {Cilia and flagella perform diverse roles in motility and sensory perception, and defects in their construction or their function are responsible for human genetic diseases termed ciliopathies. Cilia and flagella construction relies on intraflagellar transport (IFT), the bi-directional movement of 'trains' composed of protein complexes found between axoneme microtubules and the flagellum membrane. Although extensive information about IFT components and their mode of action were discovered in the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, other model organisms have revealed further insights about IFT. This is the case of Trypanosoma brucei, a flagellated protist responsible for sleeping sickness that is turning out to be an emerging model for studying IFT. In this article, we review different aspects of IFT, based on studies of Chlamydomonas and Trypanosoma. Data available from both models are examined to ask challenging questions about IFT such as the initiation of flagellum construction, the setting-up of IFT and the mode of formation of IFT trains, and their remodeling at the tip as well as their recycling at the base. Another outstanding question is the individual role played by the multiple IFT proteins. The use of different models, bringing their specific biological and experimental advantages, will be invaluable in order to obtain a global understanding of IFT.},

To maximize the utility of FbFPs, there is a pressing need to expand and diversify the limited FbFP library through the inclusion of bright and robust variants. In this work, we use genome mining to identify and engineer two new FbFPs (CreiLOV and VafLOV) from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Vaucheria frigida. We show that CreiLOV is a thermostable, photostable, and fast-maturing monomeric reporter that outperforms existing FbFPs in brightness and operational pH range. Furthermore, we show that CreiLOV can be used to monitor dynamic gene expression in Escherichia coli. Overall, our work introduces CreiLOV as a robust addition to the FbFP repertoire and highlights genome mining as a powerful approach to engineer improved FbFPs.},

  abstract = {Primary cilia function as a sensory signaling compartment in processes ranging from mammalian Hedgehog signaling to neuronal control of obesity. Intraflagellar transport (IFT) is an ancient, conserved mechanism required to assemble cilia and for trafficking within cilia. The link between IFT, sensory signaling, and obesity is not clearly defined, but some novel monogenic obesity disorders may be linked to ciliary defects. The tubby mouse, which presents with adult-onset obesity, arises from mutation in the Tub gene. The tubby-like proteins comprise a related family of poorly understood proteins with roles in neural development and function. We find that specific Tubby family proteins, notably Tubby-like protein 3 (TULP3), bind to the IFT-A complex. IFT-A is linked to retrograde ciliary transport, but, surprisingly, we find that the IFT-A complex has a second role directing ciliary entry of TULP3. TULP3 and IFT-A, in turn, promote trafficking of a subset of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), but not Smoothened, to cilia. Both IFT-A and membrane phosphoinositide-binding properties of TULP3 are required for ciliary GPCR localization. TULP3 and IFT-A proteins both negatively regulate Hedgehog signaling in the mouse embryo, and the TULP3-IFT-A interaction suggests how these proteins cooperate during neural tube patterning.},

However, despite the identification of 12 BBS genes, the molecular basis of BBS remains elusive. Here we identify a complex composed of seven highly conserved BBS proteins. This complex, the BBSome, localizes to nonmembranous centriolar satellites in the cytoplasm but also to the membrane of the cilium. Interestingly, the BBSome is required for ciliogenesis but is dispensable for centriolar satellite function. This ciliogenic function is mediated in part by the Rab8 GDP/GTP exchange factor, which localizes to the basal body and contacts the BBSome. Strikingly, Rab8(GTP) enters the primary cilium and promotes extension of the ciliary membrane. Conversely, preventing Rab8(GTP) production blocks ciliation in cells and yields characteristic BBS phenotypes in zebrafish. Our data reveal that BBS may be caused by defects in vesicular transport to the cilium.},

  abstract = {Proteins segregate into discrete subcellular compartments via a variety of mechanisms, including motor protein transport, local binding, and diffusion barriers. This physical separation of cell functions serves, in part, as a mechanism for controlling compartment activity by allowing regulation of local protein concentrations. In this study we explored how soluble protein size impacts access to the confined space within the retinal photoreceptor outer segment signaling compartment and discovered a strikingly steep relationship. We find that GFP monomers, dimers, and trimers expressed transgenically in frog rods are present in the outer segment at 1.8-, 2.9-, and 6.8-fold lower abundances, relative to the cell body, than the small soluble fluorescent marker, calcein. Theoretical analysis, based on statistical-mechanical models of molecular access to polymer meshes, shows that these observations can be explained by the steric hindrance of molecules occupying the highly constrained spaces between outer segment disc membranes. This mechanism may answer a long-standing question of how the soluble regulatory protein, arrestin, is effectively excluded from the outer segments of dark-adapted rods and cones. Generally, our results suggest an alternate mode for the control of protein access to cell domains based on dynamic, size-dependent compartmental partitioning that does not require diffusion barriers, active transport, or large numbers of immobile binding sites.},

Indeed, a growing body of literature addresses EHD protein structure, interactions with binding partners, functions in mammalian cells, and the generation of various new model systems. Accordingly, this is now an opportune time to pause and review the function and mechanisms of action of EHD proteins, and to highlight some of the challenges and future directions for the field.},

Multi-nucleated cells with unevenly distributed nuclei reveal that nuclei surrounded by a greater volume of cytoplasm grow more rapidly. During interphase of the cell cycle nuclear growth is proportional to cell growth, and during mitosis there is a rapid expansion of the nuclear envelope. When the nuclear/cell (N/C) volume ratio is increased by centrifugation or genetic manipulation, nuclear growth is arrested while the cell continues to grow; in contrast, low N/C ratios are rapidly corrected by nuclear growth. We propose that there is a general cellular control linking nuclear growth to cell size.},

We have designed a genetic screen that facilitates isolation of algal strains that efficiently express introduced transgenes. The levels of accumulation of foreign protein in our expression strains are almost uniformly high in all transgenic clones and are little influenced by position effects. The possibility of expressing transgenes to high levels will greatly facilitate post-genomics research in Chlamydomonas, and will also boost exploitation of the alga as an inexpensive production host for biopharmaceuticals and other valuable compounds.},

The nuclease lobe also contains a carboxyl-terminal domain responsible for the interaction with the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM).

  abstract = {The primary cilium is a cellular organelle that coordinates signaling pathways critical for cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and homeostasis. Intraflagellar transport (IFT) plays a pivotal role in assembling primary cilia. Disruption and/or dysfunction of IFT components can cause multiple diseases, including skeletal dysplasia. However, the mechanism by which IFT regulates skeletogenesis remains elusive. Here, we show that a neural crest-specific deletion of intraflagellar transport 20 (Ift20) in mice compromises ciliogenesis and intracellular transport of collagen, which leads to osteopenia in the facial region. Whereas platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRalpha) was present on the surface of primary cilia in wild-type osteoblasts, disruption of Ift20 down-regulated PDGFRalpha production, which caused suppression of PDGF-Akt signaling, resulting in decreased osteogenic proliferation and increased cell death. Although osteogenic differentiation in cranial neural crest (CNC)-derived cells occurred normally in Ift20-mutant cells, the process of mineralization was severely attenuated due to delayed secretion of type I collagen. In control osteoblasts, procollagen was easily transported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. By contrast, despite having similar levels of collagen type 1 alpha 1 (Col1a1) expression, Ift20 mutants did not secrete procollagen because of dysfunctional ER-to-Golgi trafficking. These data suggest that in the multipotent stem cells of CNCs, IFT20 is indispensable for regulating not only ciliogenesis but also collagen intracellular trafficking. Our study introduces a unique perspective on the canonical and noncanonical functions of IFT20 in craniofacial skeletal development.},

  abstract = {The discovery of large supramolecular complexes such as the purinosome suggests that subcellular organization is central to enzyme regulation. A screen of the yeast GFP strain collection to identify proteins that assemble into visible structures identified four novel filament systems comprised of glutamate synthase, guanosine diphosphate-mannose pyrophosphorylase, cytidine triphosphate (CTP) synthase, or subunits of the eIF2/2B translation factor complex. Recruitment of CTP synthase to filaments and foci can be modulated by mutations and regulatory ligands that alter enzyme activity, arguing that the assembly of these structures is related to control of CTP synthase activity. CTP synthase filaments are evolutionarily conserved and are restricted to axons in neurons. This spatial regulation suggests that these filaments have additional functions separate from the regulation of enzyme activity. The identification of four novel filaments greatly expands the number of known intracellular filament networks and has broad implications for our understanding of how cells organize biochemical activities in the cytoplasm.},

This property allows the selection of additional secretory mutants by sedimentation of mutagenized cells on a Ludox density gradient. Colonies derived from dense cells are screened for conditional growth and secretion of invertase and acid phosphatase. The sec mutant strains that accumulate an abnormally large intracellular pool of invertase at 37 degrees C (188 mutant clones) fall into 23 complementation groups, and the distribution of mutant alleles suggests that more complementation groups could be found. Bud emergence and incorporation of a plasma membrane sulfate permease activity stop quickly after a shift to 37 degrees C. Many of the mutants are thermoreversible; upon return to the permissive temperature (25 degrees C) the accumulated invertase is secreted. Electron microscopy of sec mutant cells reveals, with one exception, the temperature-dependent accumulation of membrane-enclosed secretory organelles.

One conceptual answer to this question is by a molecular ruler, but examples of such rulers in eukaryotes are lacking. In this work, we identified a molecular ruler in eukaryotic cilia and flagella. Using cryo-electron tomography, we found that FAP59 and FAP172 form a 96-nanometer (nm)-long complex in Chlamydomonas flagella and that the absence of the complex disrupted 96-nm repeats of axonemes. Furthermore, lengthening of the FAP59/172 complex by domain duplication resulted in extension of the repeats up to 128 nm, as well as duplication of specific axonemal components. Thus, the FAP59/172 complex is the molecular ruler that determines the 96-nm repeat length and arrangements of components in cilia and flagella.},

We transfected GPCR expression vectors into NIH3T3 cells, induced ciliogenesis by serum starvation, and observed subcellular localization of GPCRs by immunofluorescent staining. We found that several GPCRs whose ligands are involved in feeding behavior, including prolactin-releasing hormone receptor (PRLHR), neuropeptide FF receptor 1 (NPFFR1), and neuromedin U receptor 1 (NMUR1), localized to the primary cilia. In addition, we found that a short form of dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2S) is efficiently transported to the primary cilia, while a long form of dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2L) is rarely transported to the primary cilia. Using an anti-Prlhr antibody, we found that Prlhr localized to the cilia on the surface of the third ventricle in the vicinity of the hypothalamic periventricular nucleus. We generated the Npy2r-Cre transgenic mouse line in which Cre-recombinase is expressed under the control of the promoter of Npy2r encoding a ciliary GPCR. By mating Npy2r-Cre mice with Ift80 flox mice, we generated Ift80 conditional knockout (CKO) mice in which Npy2r-positive cilia were diminished in number. We found that Ift80 CKO mice exhibited a body weight increase. Our results suggest that Npy2r-positive cilia are important for body weight control.},

  abstract = {The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a model organism that provides an opportunity to understand the evolution and functional biology of the lineage that includes the land plants, as well as aspects of the fundamental core biology conserved throughout the eukaryotic phylogeny. Although many tools are available to facilitate genetic, molecular biological, biochemical, and cell biological studies in Chlamydomonas, expression of unselected transgenes of interest (GOIs) has been challenging. In most methods used previously, the GOI and a selectable marker are expressed from two separate mRNAs, so that their concomitant expression is not guaranteed. In this study, we developed constructs that allow expression of an upstream GOI and downstream selectable marker from a single bicistronic mRNA. Although this approach in other systems has typically required a translation-enhancing element such as an internal ribosome-entry site for the downstream marker, we found that a short stretch of unstructured junction sequence was sufficient to obtain adequate expression of the downstream gene, presumably through post-termination reinitiation. With this system, we obtained robust expression of both endogenous and heterologous GOIs, including fluorescent proteins and tagged fusion proteins, in the vast majority of transformants, thus eliminating the need for tedious secondary screening for GOI-expressing transformants. This improved efficiency should greatly facilitate a variety of genetic and cell-biological studies in Chlamydomonas and also enable new applications such as expression-based screens and large-scale production of foreign proteins.},

In Arabidopsis thaliana, large collections of sequence-indexed insertion and chemical mutants provide potential loss-of-function alleles for most annotated genes. However, limitations for phenotypic analysis include gametophytic or early sporophytic lethality, and the ability to recombine mutant alleles in closely linked genes, especially those present as tandem duplications. Transgene-mediated gene silencing can overcome some of these shortcomings through tissue-specific, inducible and partial gene inactivation, or simultaneous targeting of several, sequence-related genes. In addition, gene silencing is a convenient approach in species or varieties for which exhaustive mutant collections are not yet available. Typically, gene function is reduced post-transcriptionally, effected by small RNAs that act in a sequence-specific manner by base pairing to complementary mRNA molecules. A recently introduced approach is the use of artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs). Here, we review various strategies for small RNA-based gene silencing, and describe in detail the design and application of amiRNAs in many plant species.},

  abstract = {Ciliary compartmentalization plays pivotal roles in ciliogenesis and in various signaling pathways.

This complex consists of the terminal plate, which serves as a cytosolic "ciliary pore complex" (CPC), and a membrane region well suited to serve as a diffusion barrier. The CPC is a plate-shaped structure containing nine pores through which the microtubule doublets of the basal body pass. Each pore expands from the doublet B-tubule into an opening well suited for the passage of intraflagellar transport particles. The membrane diffusion barrier encompasses an extended region of detergent-resistant periciliary membrane (ciliary pocket) and a ring complex that connects the CPC to the membrane. Proteomics analysis shows involvement of the ciliary pocket in vesicle trafficking, suggesting that this region plays an active role in membrane transport. The CPC and the ring together form a complete partition defining the ciliary boundary.},

  abstract = {Our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of Ca2+ signaling as well as our appreciation for its ubiquitous role in cellular processes has been rapidly advanced, in large part, due to the development of fluorescent Ca2+ indicators. In this chapter, we discuss some of the most common chemical Ca2+ indicators that are widely used for the investigation of intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Advantages, limitations and relevant procedures will be presented for each dye including their spectral qualities, dissociation constants, chemical forms, loading methods and equipment for optimal imaging. Chemical indicators now available allow for intracellular Ca2+ detection over a very large range (<50 nM to >50 microM). High affinity indicators can be used to quantify Ca2+ levels in the cytosol while lower affinity indicators can be optimized for measuring Ca2+ in subcellular compartments with higher concentrations. Indicators can be classified into either single wavelength or ratiometric dyes. Both classes require specific lasers, filters, and/or detection methods that are dependent upon their spectral properties and both classes have advantages and limitations. Single wavelength indicators are generally very bright and optimal for Ca2+ detection when more than one fluorophore is being imaged. Ratiometric indicators can be calibrated very precisely and they minimize the most common problems associated with chemical Ca2+ indicators including uneven dye loading, leakage, photobleaching, and changes in cell volume. Recent technical advances that permit in vivo Ca2+ measurements will also be discussed.},

  abstract = {The intraflagellar transport (IFT) system is essential for bidirectional movement of ciliary components from the basal body to the tip beneath the ciliary sheath and is conserved for cilia and flagella formation in most vertebrates. IFT complex A is involved in anterograde trafficking, whereas complex B is involved in retrograde trafficking. IFT46 is well known as a crucial component of IFT complex B, however, its developmental functions are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the novel functions of IFT46 during vertebrate development, especially, ciliogenesis and neurogenesis, because IFT46 is strongly expressed in both multiciliated cells of epithelial and neural tissues. Knockdown of IFT46 using morpholino microinjections caused shortening of the body axis as well as the formation of fewer and shorter cilia. Furthermore, loss of IFT46 down-regulated the expression of the neural plate and neural tube markers, thus may influence Wnt/planar cell polarity and the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway during neurogenesis. In addition, loss of IFT46 caused craniofacial defects by interfering with cartilage formation. In conclusion, our results depict that IFT46 plays important roles in cilia as well as in neural and craniofacial development.},

Microfluidics allows high-throughput manipulation and analysis of single cells in precisely controlled microenvironment. Fluorescence imaging based quantitative measurement of lipid droplet accumulation in microalgae had been difficult due to their intrinsic motile behavior. We present a simple surface immobilization method using gelatin coating as the "biological glue". We take advantage of hydroxyproline (Hyp)-based non-covalent interaction between gelatin and the outer cell wall of microalgae to anchor the cells inside the microfluidic device. We have continuously monitored single microalgal cells for up to 6 days. The immobilized microalgae remain viable (viability was comparable to bulk suspension cultured controls). When exposed to wall shear stress, most of the cells remain attached upto 0.1 dyne/cm2 . Surface immobilization allowed high-resolution, live-cell imaging of mitotic process in real time-which followed previously reported stages in mitosis of suspension cultured cells. Use of gelatin coated microfluidics devices can result in better methods for microalgae strain screening and culture condition optimization that will help microalgal biodiesel become more economically viable.

  abstract = {Retrograde intraflagellar transport (IFT) is required for assembly of cilia. We identify a Chlamydomonas flagellar protein (flagellar-associated protein 163 [FAP163]) as being closely related to the D1bIC(FAP133) intermediate chain (IC) of the dynein that powers this movement. Biochemical analysis revealed that FAP163 is present in the flagellar matrix and is actively trafficked by IFT. Furthermore, FAP163 copurified with D1bIC(FAP133) and the LC8 dynein light chain, indicating that it is an integral component of the retrograde IFT dynein. To assess the functional role of FAP163, we generated an RNA interference knockdown of the orthologous protein (WD60) in planaria. The Smed-wd60(RNAi) animals had a severe ciliary assembly defect that dramatically compromised whole-organism motility. Most cilia were present as short stubs that had accumulated large quantities of IFT particle-like material between the doublet microtubules and the membrane. The few remaining approximately full-length cilia had a chaotic beat with a frequency reduced from 24 to approximately 10 Hz. Thus WD60/FAP163 is a dynein IC that is absolutely required for retrograde IFT and ciliary assembly.},

  abstract = {Cilia and flagella have attracted tremendous attention in recent years as research demonstrated crucial roles for these organelles in coordinating a number of physiologically and developmentally important signaling pathways, including the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) alpha, Sonic hedgehog, polycystin, and Wnt pathways. In addition, the realization that defective assembly or function of cilia can cause a plethora of diseases and developmental defects ("ciliopathies") has increased focus on the mechanisms by which these antenna-like, microtubular structures assemble. Ciliogenesis is a complex, multistep process that is tightly coordinated with cell cycle progression and differentiation. The ciliary axoneme is extended from a modified centriole, the basal body, which migrates to and docks onto the apical plasma membrane early in ciliogenesis as cells enter growth arrest. The ciliary axoneme is elongated via intraflagellar transport (IFT), a bidirectional transport system that tracks along the polarized microtubules of the axoneme, and which is required for assembly of almost all cilia and flagella. Here, we provide an overview of ciliogenesis with particular emphasis on the molecular mechanisms and functions of IFT. In addition to a general, up-to-date description of IFT, we discuss mechanisms by which proteins are selectively targeted to the ciliary compartment, with special focus on the ciliary transition zone. Finally, we briefly review the role of IFT in cilia-mediated signaling, including how IFT is directly involved in moving signaling moieties into and out of the ciliary compartment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bidirectional intraflagellar transport (IFT) consists of two major protein complexes, IFT-A and IFT-B. In contrast to the IFT-B complex, all components of IFT-A have recently been linked to human ciliopathies when defective. We therefore hypothesised that mutations in additional IFT-B encoding genes can be found in patients with multisystemic ciliopathies. METHODS: We screened 1628 individuals with reno-ocular ciliopathies by targeted next-generation sequencing of ciliary candidate genes, including all IFT-B encoding genes. RESULTS: Consequently, we identified a homozygous mutation in IFT81 affecting an obligatory donor splice site in an individual with nephronophthisis and polydactyly. Further, we detected a loss-of-stop mutation with extension of the deduced protein by 10 amino acids in an individual with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis-1. This proband presented with retinal dystrophy and brain lesions including cerebellar atrophy, a phenotype to which the IFT81 variant might contribute. Cultured fibroblasts of this latter affected individual showed a significant decrease in ciliated cell abundance compared with controls and increased expression of the transcription factor GLI2 suggesting deranged sonic hedgehog signalling. CONCLUSIONS: This work describes identification of mutations of IFT81 in individuals with symptoms consistent with the clinical spectrum of ciliopathies. It might represent the rare case of a core IFT-B complex protein found associated with human disease. Our data further suggest that defects in the IFT-B core are an exceedingly rare finding, probably due to its indispensable role for ciliary assembly in development.},

This capability has significant benefits for investigating cellular function over extended timescales, as we have illustrated using the agonist-induced G-protein coupled receptor/beta-arrestin interaction. The potential for studying the modulation of such interactions by agonists, antagonists, inhibitors, dominant negative mutants and co-expressed accessory proteins is substantial. Furthermore, the advantages of eBRET have important implications for the development of high-throughput BRET screening systems, an ever-expanding area of interest for the pharmaceutical industry.},

As an alternative to immunofluorescence microscopy, the expression of gfp gene fusions has been used to probe the function of cellular components fundamental for DNA replication, translation, protein export, and signal transduction, that heretofore have been difficult to study in living cells. Moreover, protein and DNA localization can now be monitored in real time, revealing that several proteins important for cell division, development and sporulation are dynamically localized throughout the cell cycle.

In photosynthetic organisms these differences have not been fully explored because gene-discovery approaches are mainly based on homology searches with known DDR/DNA repair proteins. Here we performed a forward genetic screen in the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to identify genes deficient in DDR/DNA repair. We isolated five insertional mutants that were sensitive to various genotoxic insults and two of them exhibited altered efficiency of transgene integration. To identify genomic regions disrupted in these mutants, we established a novel adaptor-ligation strategy for the efficient recovery of the insertion flanking sites. Four mutants harbored deletions that involved known DNA repair factors, DNA Pol zeta, DNA Pol theta, SAE2/COM1, and two neighbouring genes encoding ERCC1 and RAD17. Deletion in the last mutant spanned two Chlamydomonas-specific genes with unknown function, demonstrating the utility of this approach for discovering novel factors involved in genome maintenance.},

Data are presented demonstrating that use of an especially proficient 'extended FMDV 2A' coding region allows production of two independent protein products from a dicistronic gene with almost complete efficiency. Importantly, results are also presented that demonstrate the utility of this 2A system for efficient high-level expression of foreign genes in C. reinhardtii, which has not previously been reliably achievable in this algal model system. To expand the versatility of the 2A expression system, a number of commonly used selectable marker proteins were assessed for their compatibility with the extended FMDV 2A peptide. Additional experiments demonstrate the feasibility and utility of 2A-containing dicistronic systems that rely on a strong conditional promoter for transcriptional control and a low-expression marker gene for selection. This strategy allows easy and efficient delivery of genes of interest whose expression levels require regulation either to mitigate potential toxicity or allow differential expression under controlled experimental conditions. Finally, as an additional practical demonstration of the utility of the extended FMDV 2A system, confocal fluorescence microscopy is used to demonstrate that native and foreign proteins of interest bearing post-translational remnants of the extended FMDV 2A peptide localize correctly to various cellular compartments, including a striking demonstration of the almost exclusive localization of the Rubisco small subunit protein to the pyrenoid of the C. reinhardtii chloroplast in cells maintained under ambient CO2 concentrations.},

  abstract = {Intracellular transport depends on cooperation between distinct motor proteins. Two anterograde intraflagellar transport (IFT) motors, heterotrimeric kinesin-II and homodimeric OSM-3, cooperate to move cargo along Caenorhabditis elegans cilia. Here, using quantitative fluorescence microscopy, with single-molecule sensitivity, of IFT in living strains containing single-copy transgenes encoding fluorescent IFT proteins, we show that kinesin-II transports IFT trains through the ciliary base and transition zone to a 'handover zone' on the proximal axoneme. There, OSM-3 gradually replaces kinesin-II, yielding velocity profiles inconsistent with in vitro motility assays, and then drives transport to the ciliary tip. Dissociated kinesin-II motors undergo rapid turnaround and recycling to the ciliary base, whereas OSM-3 is recycled mainly to the handover zone. This reveals a functional differentiation in which the slower, less processive kinesin-II imports IFT trains into the cilium and OSM-3 drives their long-range transport, thereby optimizing cargo delivery.},

Cellular quiescence potentiates ciliogenesis, but the regulation of basal body formation is not fully understood. We used reverse genetics to test the role of the small calcium-binding protein, centrin2, in ciliogenesis. Primary cilia arise in most cell types but have not been described in lymphocytes. We show here that serum starvation of transformed, cultured B and T cells caused primary ciliogenesis. Efficient ciliogenesis in chicken DT40 B lymphocytes required centrin2. We disrupted CETN2 in human retinal pigmented epithelial cells, and despite having intact centrioles, they were unable to make cilia upon serum starvation, showing abnormal localization of distal appendage proteins and failing to remove the ciliation inhibitor CP110. Knockdown of CP110 rescued ciliation in CETN2-deficient cells. Thus, centrin2 regulates primary ciliogenesis through controlling CP110 levels.},

We demonstrate that the ubiquitin ligase Siah2 targets a select pool of NCOR1-bound, transcriptionally-inactive AR for ubiquitin-dependent degradation, thereby promoting expression of select AR target genes implicated in lipid metabolism, cell motility, and proliferation. Siah2 is required for prostate cancer cell growth under androgen-deprivation conditions in vitro and in vivo, and Siah2 inhibition promotes prostate cancer regression upon castration. Notably, Siah2 expression is markedly increased in human CRPCs. Collectively, we find that selective regulation of AR transcriptional activity by the ubiquitin ligase Siah2 is important for CRPC development.},

  abstract = {Mechanical load plays a significant role in bone and growth-plate development. Chondrocytes sense and respond to mechanical stimulation; however, the mechanisms by which those signals exert their effects are not fully understood. The primary cilium has been identified as a mechano-sensor in several cell types, including renal epithelial cells and endothelium, and accumulating evidence connects it to mechano-transduction in chondrocytes. In the growth plate, the primary cilium is involved in several regulatory pathways, such as the non-canonical Wnt and Indian Hedgehog. Moreover, it mediates cell shape, orientation, growth, and differentiation in the growth plate. In this work, we show that mechanical load enhances ciliogenesis in the growth plate. This leads to alterations in the expression and localization of key members of the Ihh-PTHrP loop resulting in decreased proliferation and an abnormal switch from proliferation to differentiation, together with abnormal chondrocyte morphology and organization. Moreover, we use the chondrogenic cell line ATDC5, a model for growth-plate chondrocytes, to understand the mechanisms mediating the participation of the primary cilium, and in particular KIF3A, in the cell's response to mechanical stimulation. We show that this key component of the cilium mediates gene expression in response to mechanical stimulation.},

Here, we describe an approach that combines a Cas9 nickase mutant with paired guide RNAs to introduce targeted double-strand breaks. Because individual nicks in the genome are repaired with high fidelity, simultaneous nicking via appropriately offset guide RNAs is required for double-stranded breaks and extends the number of specifically recognized bases for target cleavage. We demonstrate that using paired nicking can reduce off-target activity by 50- to 1,500-fold in cell lines and to facilitate gene knockout in mouse zygotes without sacrificing on-target cleavage efficiency. This versatile strategy enables a wide variety of genome editing applications that require high specificity.},

Here we describe a nuclear expression strategy using the foot-and-mouth-disease-virus 2A self-cleavage peptide to transcriptionally fuse heterologous gene expression to antibiotic resistance in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We demonstrate that strains transformed with ble-2A-GFP are zeocin-resistant and accumulate high levels of GFP that is properly 'cleaved' at the FMDV 2A peptide resulting in monomeric, cytosolic GFP that is easily detectable by in-gel fluorescence analysis or fluorescent microscopy. Furthermore, we used our ble2A nuclear expression vector to engineer the heterologous expression of the industrial enzyme, xylanase. We demonstrate that linking xyn1 expression to ble2A expression on the same open reading frame led to a dramatic (~100-fold) increase in xylanase activity in cells lysates compared to the unlinked construct. Finally, by inserting an endogenous secretion signal between the ble2A and xyn1 coding regions, we were able to target monomeric xylanase for secretion. The novel microalgae nuclear expression strategy described here enables the selection of transgenic lines that are efficiently expressing the heterologous gene-of-interest and should prove valuable for basic research as well as algal biotechnology.},

This technique harnesses a promiscuous biotin ligase to biotinylate proteins based on proximity. The ligase is fused to a protein of interest and expressed in cells, where it biotinylates proximal endogenous proteins. Because it is a rare protein modification in nature, biotinylation of these endogenous proteins by BioID fusion proteins enables their selective isolation and identification with standard biotin-affinity capture. Proteins identified by BioID are candidate interactors for the protein of interest. BioID can be applied to insoluble proteins, can identify weak and/or transient interactions, and is amenable to temporal regulation.

BioID features proximity-dependent biotinylation of proteins that are near-neighbors of the fusion protein. Biotinylated proteins may be isolated by affinity capture and identified by mass spectrometry. We apply BioID to lamin-A (LaA), a well-characterized intermediate filament protein that is a constituent of the nuclear lamina, an important structural element of the nuclear envelope (NE). We identify multiple proteins that associate with and/or are proximate to LaA in vivo. The most abundant of these include known interactors of LaA that are localized to the NE, as well as a new NE-associated protein named SLAP75.

  abstract = {The primary cilium, critical for morphogenic and growth factor signaling, is assembled upon cell cycle exit, but the links between ciliogenesis and cell cycle progression are unclear. KV10.1 is a voltage-gated potassium channel frequently overexpressed in tumors. We have previously reported that expression of KV10.1 is temporally restricted to a time period immediately prior to mitosis in healthy cells. Here, we provide microscopical and biochemical evidence that KV10.1 localizes to the centrosome and the primary cilium and promotes ciliary disassembly. Interference with KV10.1 ciliary localization abolishes not only the effects on ciliary disassembly, but also KV10.1-induced tumor progression in vivo Conversely, upon knockdown of KV10.1, ciliary disassembly is impaired, proliferation is delayed, and proliferating cells show prominent primary cilia. Thus, modulation of ciliogenesis by KV10.1 can explain the influence of KV10.1 expression on the proliferation of normal cells and is likely to be a major mechanism underlying its tumorigenic effects.},

  abstract = {Signaling through vertebrate Hedgehog (Hh) proteins depends on the primary cilium. In response to Hh signals, the transcriptional activator of the pathway, Gli2, accumulates at the ciliary tip, raising the possibility that ciliary localization is important for Gli2 activation. To test this hypothesis, we used the Floxin system to create knock-in Gli2 alleles in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to allow methodical testing of which domains and residues are essential for the ciliary localization of Gli2. The Gli2 zinc fingers, transcriptional activation domain, repressor domain, phosphorylation cluster and a Sufu binding motif were each dispensable for ciliary localization. Mutating residues that are required for Gli2 sumoylation and nuclear trafficking also did not abrogate ciliary localization. By contrast, several other domains restricted Gli2 nuclear localization, and a central region, distinct from previously characterized domains, was required for ciliary localization. In addition to an inability to localize to cilia, Gli2 lacking this central domain was unable to activate target genes. Thus, our systematic analysis in ESCs reveals that distinct regions of Gli2 regulate its nuclear and ciliary localization. The identification of a domain essential for both ciliary localization and transcriptional activity suggests that ciliary localization of Gli2 is required for its activation.},

Primary cilia function as cellular positioning systems with hedgehog and Wnt signaling pathways running through them, as well as in growth control through ciliary PDGFRααsignaling. 6. Mutations in ciliary proteins lead to ciliopathies such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, polycystic kidney disease, retinitis pigmentosa, and hydrocephalus. 7.

In contrast, single nonmotile 9+0 primary cilia are found on epithelial cells, such as those of the kidney tubule, but also on nonepithelial cells, such as chondrocytes, fibroblasts, and neurons.

The tremendous success of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool is powered by the ease design principle of the guide RNA that targets Cas9 to the desired DNA locus, and by the high specificity and efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9-generated DNA breaks. Several studies recently used CRISPR/Cas9 to successfully modulate disease-causing alleles in vivo in animal models and ex vivo in somatic and induced pluripotent stem cells, raising hope for therapeutic genome editing in the clinics.

Yet how microtubules tolerate the vast forces exerted on them remains unknown. Here, by using a microfluidic device, we show that microtubule stiffness decreases incrementally with each cycle of bending and release. Similar to other cases of material fatigue, the concentration of mechanical stresses on pre-existing defects in the microtubule lattice is responsible for the generation of more extensive damage, which further decreases microtubule stiffness. Strikingly, damaged microtubules were able to incorporate new tubulin dimers into their lattice and recover their initial stiffness. Our findings demonstrate that microtubules are ductile materials with self-healing properties, that their dynamics does not exclusively occur at their ends, and that their lattice plasticity enables the microtubules' adaptation to mechanical stresses.},

It has become apparent that endocytic transport to the cleavage furrow during late cytokinesis mediates and coordinates lipid and cytoskeleton dynamics, thus playing a key role in abscission. Furthermore, new evidence suggests that endosomes may have additional roles in post-mitotic cellular events such as midbody inheritance and degradation.

Problems inherent to these strategies, like off-target effects by unpredictable generation of siRNAs, were solved previously by constructs allowing for routine expression of specific artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs). Yet missing was a routine tool for inducible amiRNA expression, which to establish was the aim of this work. For this, we equipped a recently developed amiRNA expression vector with the NIT1 promoter, which is repressed by ammonium and activated by nitrate. We tested this conditional amiRNA vector with heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) as target. HSF1 transcripts in transformants were already reduced ~2 h after transfer from ammonium to nitrate-containing medium. In contrast, HSF1 protein levels declined only ~8 h after the shift and were strongly reduced after 24 h, suggesting that HSF1 is a stable protein and diluted out by growth. HSF1 levels recovered partly when transformant cells were shifted back to ammonium for 72 h. Transformants developed thermosensitivity only on nitrate and thermosensitivity correlated with strong reduction in HSF1 levels, hence supporting our earlier conclusion that HSF1 is a key regulator for thermotolerance in Chlamydomonas.},

Subsequent research has supported the hypothesis that IFT is required for the assembly and maintenance of all cilia and flagella and that its underlying mechanism involves the transport of nonmembrane-bound macromolecular protein complexes (IFT particles) along axonemal MTs beneath the ciliary membrane. IFT requires the action of the anterograde kinesin-II motors and the retrograde IFT-dynein motors to transport IFT particles in opposite directions along the MT polymer lattice from the basal body to the tip of the axoneme and back again. A rich diversity of biological processes has been shown to depend upon IFT, including flagellar length control, cell swimming, mating and feeding, photoreception, animal development, sensory perception, chemosensory behavior, and lifespan control. These processes reflect the varied roles of cilia and flagella in motility and sensory signaling.},

  abstract = {The generation of a comprehensive EST library and the sequencing of its genome set the stage for reverse genetics approaches in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. However, these also require tools for the specific downregulation of target gene expression. Consequently, a large number of diverse constructs were developed aimed at reducing target gene expression in Chlamydomonas via the stable expression of antisense or inverted repeat-containing RNA. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) generated by the annealing of antisense and sense RNAs or by hairpin formation of an inverted repeat, feeds into the RNA silencing pathway. In this pathway, dsRNA is cleaved into approximately 25-bp small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by the endonuclease Dicer. One of the two complementary strands of a siRNA is then loaded onto an Argonaute-like protein present as core component within larger complexes. Guided by this single-stranded RNA, the Argonaute-like protein either detects homologous transcripts and cleaves these endonucleolytically, or initiates transcriptional gene silencing. This article summarizes current information derived mainly from the Chlamydomonas genome project on components that are assumed to be involved in RNA silencing mechanisms in Chlamydomonas. Furthermore, all approaches employed in Chlamydomonas to date to downregulate target gene expression by antisense or inverted repeat constructs are reviewed and discussed critically.},

The larger form is synthesized preferentially during heat shock, whereas the smaller one dominates at lower temperatures. Fractions of both HSP70B and CGE1 associate with chloroplast membranes in an ATP-sensitive manner. By colorless native PAGE and pulse labeling, CGE1 monomers were found to assemble rapidly into dimers and tetramers. In addition, CGE1 was found to form ATP-sensitive complexes with HSP70B of approximately 230 and approximately 120 kD, the latter increasing dramatically after heat shock.},

  abstract = {Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) affect only a small number of targets with high sequence complementarity, while animal miRNAs usually have hundreds of targets with limited complementarity. We used artificial miRNAs (amiRNAs) to determine whether the narrow action spectrum of natural plant miRNAs reflects only intrinsic properties of the plant miRNA machinery or whether it is also due to past selection against natural miRNAs with broader specificity. amiRNAs were designed to target individual genes or groups of endogenous genes. Like natural miRNAs, they had varying numbers of target mismatches. Previously determined parameters of target selection for natural miRNAs could accurately predict direct targets of amiRNAs. The specificity of amiRNAs, as deduced from genome-wide expression profiling, was as high as that of natural plant miRNAs, supporting the notion that extensive base pairing with targets is required for plant miRNA function. amiRNAs make an effective tool for specific gene silencing in plants, especially when several related, but not identical, target genes need to be downregulated. We demonstrate that amiRNAs are also active when expressed under tissue-specific or inducible promoters, with limited nonautonomous effects. The design principles for amiRNAs have been generalized and integrated into a Web-based tool (http://wmd.weigelworld.org).},

This so-called BioID method provides an alternative to the widely used co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) to identify protein-protein interactions. Here, we used BioID, on its own and combined with co-IP, to identify proteins involved in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a post-transcriptional mRNA turnover pathway that targets mRNAs that fail to terminate translation properly. In particular, we expressed BirA* fused to the well characterized NMD factors UPF1, UPF2 and SMG5 and detected by liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) the streptavidin-purified biotinylated proteins. While the identified already known interactors confirmed the usefulness of BioID, we also found new potentially important interactors that have escaped previous detection by co-IP, presumably because they associate only weakly and/or very transiently with the NMD machinery. Our results suggest that SMG5 only transiently contacts the UPF1-UPF2-UPF3 complex and that it provides a physical link to the decapping complex. In addition, BioID revealed among others CRKL and EIF4A2 as putative novel transient interactors with NMD factors, but whether or not they have a function in NMD remains to be elucidated.},

Although the alga is easily transformable, the low efficiency of transgene expression from the Chlamydomonas nuclear genome has severely hampered functional genomics research. For example, poor transgene expression is held responsible for the lack of sensitive reporter genes to monitor gene expression in vivo, analyze subcellular protein localization or study protein-protein interactions. Here, we have tested the luciferase from the marine copepod Gaussia princeps (G-Luc) for its suitability as a sensitive bioluminescent reporter of gene expression in Chlamydomonas. We show that a Gaussia luciferase gene variant, engineered to match the codon usage in the Chlamydomonas nuclear genome, serves as a highly sensitive reporter of gene expression from both constitutive and inducible algal promoters. Its bioluminescence signal intensity greatly surpasses previously developed reporters for Chlamydomonas nuclear gene expression and reaches values high enough for utilizing the reporter as a tool to monitor responses to environmental stresses in vivo and to conduct high-throughput screenings for signaling mutants in Chlamydomonas.},

Furthermore, we demonstrated that this method outperforms our recently developed somatic TALEN technique and enables the one-step generation of multiple conditional knockouts. By combining these techniques with live-cell imaging, we showed that an essential embryonic gene, Coronin, which is associated with human neurobehavioral dysfunction, regulates actin organization and cell morphology during C. elegans postembryonic neuroblast migration and neuritogenesis. We propose that the somatic CRISPR-Cas9 platform is uniquely suited for conditional gene editing-based biomedical research.},

  abstract = {Genome editing is crucial for genetic engineering of organisms for improved traits, particularly in microalgae due to the urgent necessity for the next generation biofuel production. The most advanced CRISPR/Cas9 system is simple, efficient and accurate in some organisms; however, it has proven extremely difficult in microalgae including the model alga Chlamydomonas. We solved this problem by delivering Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) comprising the Cas9 protein and sgRNAs to avoid cytotoxicity and off-targeting associated with vector-driven expression of Cas9. We obtained CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutations at three loci including MAA7, CpSRP43 and ChlM, and targeted mutagenic efficiency was improved up to 100 fold compared to the first report of transgenic Cas9-induced mutagenesis. Interestingly, we found that unrelated vectors used for the selection purpose were predominantly integrated at the Cas9 cut site, indicative of NHEJ-mediated knock-in events. As expected with Cas9 RNPs, no off-targeting was found in one of the mutagenic screens. In conclusion, we improved the knockout efficiency by using Cas9 RNPs, which opens great opportunities not only for biological research but also industrial applications in Chlamydomonas and other microalgae. Findings of the NHEJ-mediated knock-in events will allow applications of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in microalgae, including "safe harboring" techniques shown in other organisms.},

  abstract = {Cilia and flagella, sensory and motile structures protruding from the cell body, rely on the continuous bidirectional traffic of intraflagellar transport (IFT) particles to ferry flagellar precursors into flagella for assembly. Cells synthesize a large pool of IFT particle proteins in the cell body, but only a small portion engages in active transport within the flagella at any given time. The atypical small G protein Rab-like 5 (RABL5) has been shown to move in an IFT-like manner in the flagella, but its function in ciliogenesis is controversial. In this report, we demonstrate that IFT22, the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii homolog of RABL5, is a bona fide IFT particle complex B subunit. Although the amount of IFT22 remains unaffected by depletion of either complex A or B, depletion of IFT22 leads to a smaller pool of both complex A and B. Strikingly, the smaller cellular pool of IFT particles does not lead to a reduced distribution of IFT particles to flagella. Instead, the amount of IFT particle proteins, including IFT22 itself, increase in the flagella. Moreover, cells over-expressing IFT22 also accumulate IFT particles in their flagella. Taken together, these data indicate that, in C. reinhardtii, IFT22 controls the cellular levels of both complex A and B, thus plays a critical role in determining the cellular availability of IFT particles. In addition, although IFT22 may not directly carry any precursors for flagellar assembly, it controls how many IFT particles participate in ferrying precursors into flagella.},

Rat PI-TP expression effected a specific complementation of sec14ts growth and secretory defects. Complementation of sec14 mutations was not absolute as rat PI-TP expression failed to rescue sec14 null mutations. This partial complementation of sec14 lesions by rat PI-TP correlated with inability of the mammalian protein to stably associate with yeast Golgi membranes and was not a result of rat PI-TP stabilizing the endogenous sec14ts gene product. These collective data demonstrate that while the in vitro PI-TP activity of SEC14p clearly reflects some functional in vivo property of SEC14p, the PI-TP activity is not the sole essential activity of SEC14p. Those data further identify an efficient Golgi targeting capability as a likely essential feature of SEC14p function in vivo. Finally, the data suggest that stable association of SEC14p with yeast Golgi membranes is not a simple function of its lipid-binding properties, indicate that the amino-terminal 129 SEC14p residues are sufficient to direct a catalytically inactive form of rat PI-TP to the Golgi and provide the first evidence to indicate that a mammalian PI-TP can stimulate Golgi secretory function in vivo.},

Cas9 creates double-strand breaks (DSBs) at targeted genomic loci complementary to a short RNA guide. However, Cas9 can cleave off-target sites that are not fully complementary to the guide, which poses a major challenge for genome editing. Here, we use structure-guided protein engineering to improve the specificity of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9). Using targeted deep sequencing and unbiased whole-genome off-target analysis to assess Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage in human cells, we demonstrate that "enhanced specificity" SpCas9 (eSpCas9) variants reduce off-target effects and maintain robust on-target cleavage.

  abstract = {Over recent years, the pathways for the biosynthesis of many vitamins have been elucidated at the molecular level in plants, and several unique features are emerging. One is that the mitochondrion plays an important role in the synthesis of folate (vitamin B9), biotin (B7), pantothenate (B5), ascorbate (C), and possibly thiamin (B1). Second, the production of some of these cofactors is regulated by developmental cues, and perhaps more surprisingly, by environmental signals such as high light and salinity. Moreover, the biosynthesis of thiamin in Arabidopsis may be negatively regulated by a riboswitch, a novel method of gene regulation that is characteristic of cofactor biosynthesis in bacteria. Vitamin B12 is unique in that it is not found in vascular plants, but is abundant in algae; recent molecular work has revealed that algae do not synthesise the vitamin but instead obtain it from bacteria.},

There is a need for techniques to monitor interactions of endogenous proteins directly in individual cells and tissues to reveal the cellular and molecular architecture and its responses to perturbations. Here we report our adaptation of the recently developed proximity ligation method to examine the subcellular localization of protein-protein interactions at single-molecule resolution. Proximity probes-oligonucleotides attached to antibodies against the two target proteins-guided the formation of circular DNA strands when bound in close proximity. The DNA circles in turn served as templates for localized rolling-circle amplification (RCA), allowing individual interacting pairs of protein molecules to be visualized and counted in human cell lines and clinical specimens. We used this method to show specific regulation of protein-protein interactions between endogenous Myc and Max oncogenic transcription factors in response to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) signaling and low-molecular-weight inhibitors.},

Yet its current resolution is not sufficient to precisely localize or identify most proteins in situ; for example, the location and arrangement of components of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), a key regulator of ciliary/flagellar motility that is conserved from algae to humans, have remained elusive despite many cryo-ET studies of cilia and flagella. Here, we developed an in situ localization method that combines cryo-ET/subtomogram averaging with the clonable SNAP tag, a widely used cell biological probe to visualize fusion proteins by fluorescence microscopy. Using this hybrid approach, we precisely determined the locations of the N and C termini of DRC3 and the C terminus of DRC4 within the three-dimensional structure of the N-DRC in Chlamydomonas flagella. Our data demonstrate that fusion of SNAP with target proteins allowed for protein localization with high efficiency and fidelity using SNAP-linked gold nanoparticles, without disrupting the native assembly, structure, or function of the flagella. After cryo-ET and subtomogram averaging, we localized DRC3 to the L1 projection of the nexin linker, which interacts directly with a dynein motor, whereas DRC4 was observed to stretch along the N-DRC base plate to the nexin linker. Application of the technique developed here to the N-DRC revealed new insights into the organization and regulatory mechanism of this complex, and provides a valuable tool for the structural dissection of macromolecular complexes in situ.},

  abstract = {Cells from a variety of sources, principally differentiating fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells from neonatal chicken and mammalian tissues and from organ cultures of chicken duodenum, were used as materials for an electron microscopic study on the formation of rudimentary cilia. Among the differentiating tissues many cells possessed a short, solitary cilium, which projected from one of the cell's pair of centrioles. Many stages evidently intermediate in the fashioning of cilium from centriole were encountered and furnished the evidence from which a reconstruction of ciliogenesis was attempted. The whole process may be divided into three phases. At first a solitary vesicle appears at one end of a centriole. The ciliary bud grows out from the same end of the centriole and invaginates the sac, which then becomes the temporary ciliary sheath. During the second phase the bud lengthens into a shaft, while the sheath enlarges to contain it. Enlargement of the sheath is effected by the repeated appearance of secondary vesicles nearby and their fusion with the sheath. Shaft and sheath reach the surface of the cell, where the sheath fuses with the plasma membrane during the third phase. Up to this point, formation of cilia follows the classical descriptions in outline. Subsequently, internal development of the shaft makes the rudimentary cilia of the investigated material more like certain non-motile centriolar derivatives than motile cilia. The pertinent literature is examined, and the cilia are tentatively assigned a non-motile status and a sensory function.},

To date, most studies of transgenic Chlamydomonas have utilized the chloroplast genome due to its ease of engineering, with a sizeable suite of reporters and well-characterized expression constructs. The advanced manipulation of algal nuclear genomes has been hampered by limited strong expression cassettes, and a lack of high-throughput reporters. We have improved upon an endogenous reporter gene - the ARS2 gene encoding an arylsulfatase enzyme - that was first cloned and characterized decades ago but has not been used extensively. The new construct, derived from ARS2 cDNA, expresses significantly higher levels of reporter protein and transforms more efficiently, allowing qualitative and quantitative screening using a rapid, inexpensive 96-well assay. The improved arylsulfatase expression cassette was used to screen a new transgene promoter from the ARG7 gene, and found that the ARG7 promoter can express the ARS2 reporter as strongly as the HSP70-RBCS2 chimeric promoter that currently ranks as the best available promoter, thus adding to the list of useful nuclear promoters. This enhanced arylsulfatase reporter construct improves the efficiency and ease of genetic engineering within the Chlamydomonas nuclear genome, with potential application to other algal strains.},

We have purified complexes associated with CP110, a protein that plays an essential role in centrosome duplication and cytokinesis, and have identified a previously uncharacterized protein, Cep97, that recruits CP110 to centrosomes. Depletion of Cep97 or expression of dominant-negative mutants results in CP110 disappearance from centrosomes, spindle defects, and polyploidy. Remarkably, loss of Cep97 or CP110 promotes primary cilia formation in growing cells, and enforced expression of CP110 in quiescent cells suppresses their ability to assemble cilia, suggesting that Cep97 and CP110 collaborate to inhibit a ciliogenesis program. Identification of Cep97 and other genes involved in regulation of cilia assembly may accelerate our understanding of human ciliary diseases, including renal disease and retinal degeneration.},

Here we show that many common lichens are composed of the known ascomycete, the photosynthesizing partner, and, unexpectedly, specific basidiomycete yeasts. These yeasts are embedded in the cortex, and their abundance correlates with previously unexplained variations in phenotype. Basidiomycete lineages maintain close associations with specific lichen species over large geographical distances and have been found on six continents.

A longstanding question in cilium structure and function is why the microtubule arrangement in cilia is so complex. Stepanek and Pigino developed a time-resolved correlative fluorescence and three-dimensional electron microscopy method to show that the doublets provide directionality to intraflagellar transport. One microtubule in the pair moves cargoes up to the ciliary tip. Meanwhile, the other microtubule moves cargoes back to the cell body. These results explain why the axoneme is built out of microtubule doublets and suggest a mechanistic picture of how the logistics of bidirectional intraflagellar transport are regulated.Science, this issue p. 721The cilium is a large macromolecular machine that is vital for motility, signaling, and sensing in most eukaryotic cells. Its conserved core structure, the axoneme, contains nine microtubule doublets, each comprising a full A-microtubule and an incomplete B-microtubule. However, thus far, the function of this doublet geometry has not been understood. We developed a time-resolved correlative fluorescence and three-dimensional electron microscopy approach to investigate the dynamics of intraflagellar transport (IFT) trains, which carry ciliary building blocks along microtubules during the assembly and disassembly of the cilium. Using this method, we showed that each microtubule doublet is used as a bidirectional double-track railway: Anterograde IFT trains move along B-microtubules, and retrograde trains move along A-microtubules. Thus, the microtubule doublet geometry provides direction-specific rails to coordinate bidirectional transport of ciliary components.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tubby is the founding member of the tubby-like family of proteins. The naturally occurring tubby mutation in mice causes retinitis pigmentosa, hearing loss and obesity. Tubby has been proposed to function as an accessory factor in ciliary trafficking. We directly examined a role for tubby in ciliary trafficking in vivo. METHODS: We used immunofluoresence labeling to examine the subcellular localization of rhodopsin, somatostatin receptor 3 (SSTR3) and melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1), all of which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), in the retina and brain of wild type (WT) and tubby mutant mice. RESULTS: In tubby mouse retina, rhodopsin is not fully transported across the connecting cilia to the outer segments with ensuing photoreceptor degeneration. In the tubby mouse brain, SSTR3 and MCHR1 fail to localize at the neuronal primary cilia in regions where these receptors play critical roles in neural signaling. The tubby mutant does not manifest a generalized defect in ciliogenesis or protein trafficking. CONCLUSIONS: Tubby plays a critical role in trafficking select GPCRs to the cilia. This role is reminiscent of tubby-like proteins 1 and 3, which have been proposed to facilitate trafficking of rhodopsin and select GPCRs in photoreceptors and the developing neural tube, respectively. Thus tubby-like proteins may be generally involved in transciliary trafficking of GPCRs.},

In addition, it shows how many different complexes exist that share a common subunit, whether free monomeric forms of individual subunits exist, and whether these parameters change upon cell stimulation.

The fusion proteins were targeted to membranes via lipid modifications (palmitoylation and myristoylation) as opposed to membrane spanning domains. Membrane association was found to be necessary but not sufficient for efficient ROS localization. A GFP fusion protein containing only the cytoplasmic COOH-terminal 44 amino acids of Xenopus rhodopsin localized exclusively to ROS membranes. Chimeras between rhodopsin and alpha adrenergic receptor COOH-terminal sequences further refined rhodopsin's ROS localization signal to its distal eight amino acids. Mutations/deletions of this region resulted in partial delocalization of the fusion proteins to rod inner segment (RIS) membranes.

  abstract = {Correct positioning of the cell division machinery is key to genome stability. Schizosaccharomyces pombe is an attractive organism to study cytokinesis as it, like higher eukaryotes, divides using a contractile actomyosin ring. In S. pombe, many actomyosin ring components assemble at the medial cortex into node-like structures before coalescing into a ring [1, 2]. Assembly of cytokinetic nodes requires Mid1p, which recruits IQGAP-related Rng2p to the division site, after which other node components accumulate at the division site in a characteristic sequence [3-6]. How cytokinetic nodes assemble, whether the order of assembly of ring components is important, and whether Mid1p solely participates in ring positioning are poorly understood. Here, we show that synthetic targeting of IQGAP-related Rng2p, formin-Cdc12p, and myosin II (Myo2p) restores medial division in mid1 mutants, suggesting that ring proteins need not assemble at the division site in an invariant order. Unlike in wild-type cells, actomyosin rings in cells rewired to divide medially in the absence of Mid1p assemble late in anaphase. Furthermore, the rewiring process affects the ability of the actomyosin ring to track the nucleus upon perturbation of nuclear position. Our work reveals the power of synthetic rewiring studies in deciphering roles performed by multifunctional proteins.},

  abstract = {Cilia are microtubule-based organelles that assemble via intraflagellar transport (IFT) and function as signaling hubs on eukaryotic cells. IFT relies on molecular motors and IFT complexes that mediate the contacts with ciliary cargo. To elucidate the architecture of the IFT-B complex, we reconstituted and purified the nonameric IFT-B core from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and determined the crystal structures of C. reinhardtii IFT70/52 and Tetrahymena IFT52/46 subcomplexes. The 2.5-A resolution IFT70/52 structure shows that IFT52330-370 is buried deeply within the IFT70 tetratricopeptide repeat superhelix. Furthermore, the polycystic kidney disease protein IFT88 binds IFT52281-329 in a complex that interacts directly with IFT70/IFT52330-381 in trans. The structure of IFT52C/IFT46C was solved at 2.3 A resolution, and we show that it is essential for IFT-B core integrity by mediating interaction between IFT88/70/52/46 and IFT81/74/27/25/22 subcomplexes. Consistent with this, overexpression of mammalian IFT52C in MDCK cells is dominant-negative and causes IFT protein mislocalization and disrupted ciliogenesis. These data further rationalize several ciliogenesis phenotypes of IFT mutant strains.},

  abstract = {Eukaryotic cilia and flagella are evolutionarily conserved organelles that protrude from the cell surface. The unique location and properties of cilia allow them to function in vital processes such as motility and signaling. Ciliary assembly and maintenance rely on intraflagellar transport (IFT), the bidirectional movement of a multicomponent transport system between the ciliary base and tip. Since its initial discovery more than two decades ago, considerable effort has been invested in dissecting the molecular mechanisms of IFT in a variety of model organisms. Importantly, IFT was shown to be essential for mammalian development, and defects in this process cause a number of human pathologies known as ciliopathies. Here, we review current knowledge of IFT with a particular emphasis on the IFT machinery and specific mechanisms of ciliary cargo recognition and transport.},

  abstract = {Intraflagellar transport (IFT) relies on the IFT complex and is required for ciliogenesis. The IFT-B complex consists of 9-10 stably associated core subunits and six "peripheral" subunits that were shown to dissociate from the core structure at moderate salt concentration. We purified the six "peripheral" IFT-B subunits of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as recombinant proteins and show that they form a stable complex independently of the IFT-B core. We suggest a nomenclature of IFT-B1 (core) and IFT-B2 (peripheral) for the two IFT-B subcomplexes. We demonstrate that IFT88, together with the N-terminal domain of IFT52, is necessary to bridge the interaction between IFT-B1 and B2. The crystal structure of IFT52N reveals highly conserved residues critical for IFT-B1/IFT-B2 complex formation. Furthermore, we show that of the three IFT-B2 subunits containing a calponin homology (CH) domain (IFT38, 54, and 57), only IFT54 binds alphabeta-tubulin as a potential IFT cargo, whereas the CH domains of IFT38 and IFT57 mediate the interaction with IFT80 and IFT172, respectively. Crystal structures of IFT54 CH domains reveal that tubulin binding is mediated by basic surface-exposed residues.},

  abstract = {There is significant interest in farming algae for the direct production of biofuels and valuable lipids. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is the leading model system for studying lipid metabolism in green algae, but current methods for isolating mutants with perturbed lipid content in this organism are slow and tedious. Here, we present the Chlamydomonas High Lipid Sorting (CHiLiS) strategy, which enables enrichment of high-lipid mutants by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of pooled mutants stained with the lipid-sensitive dye Nile Red. This method only takes five weeks from mutagenesis to mutant isolation. We developed a staining protocol that allows quantitation of lipid content while preserving cell viability. We improved separation of high-lipid mutants from wild-type by using each cell's chlorophyll fluorescence as an internal control. We initially demonstrated 20-fold enrichment of the known high-lipid mutant sta1 from a mixture of sta1 and wild-type cells. We then applied CHiLiS to sort thousands of high-lipid cells from a pool of ~60,000 mutants. Flow cytometry analysis of 24 individual mutants isolated by this approach revealed that ~50% showed a reproducible high lipid phenotype. We further characterized 9 of the mutants with highest lipid content by flame ionization detection and mass spectrometry lipidomics. All mutants analyzed had higher triacylglycerol content and perturbed whole-cell fatty-acid composition. One arbitrarily chosen mutant was evaluated by microscopy, revealing larger lipid droplets than wild-type. The unprecedented throughput of CHiLiS opens the door to a systems-level understanding of green algal lipid biology by enabling genome-saturating isolation of mutants in key genes.

  abstract = {Many cargoes destined for nuclear import carry nuclear localization signals that are recognized by karyopherins (Kaps). We present methods to quantitate import rates and measure Kap and cargo concentrations in single yeast cells in vivo, providing new insights into import kinetics. By systematically manipulating the amounts, types, and affinities of Kaps and cargos, we show that import rates in vivo are simply governed by the concentrations of Kaps and their cargo and the affinity between them. These rates fit to a straightforward pump-leak model for the import process. Unexpectedly, we deduced that the main limiting factor for import is the poor ability of Kaps and cargos to find each other in the cytoplasm in a background of overwhelming nonspecific competition, rather than other more obvious candidates such as the nuclear pore complex and Ran. It is likely that most of every import round is taken up by Kaps and nuclear localization signals sampling other cytoplasmic proteins as they locate each other in the cytoplasm.},

  abstract = {Cilia use microtubule-based intraflagellar transport (IFT) to organize intercellular signaling. Ciliopathies are a spectrum of human diseases resulting from defects in cilia structure or function. The mechanisms regulating the assembly of ciliary multiprotein complexes and the transport of these complexes to the base of cilia remain largely unknown. Combining proteomics, in vivo imaging and genetic analysis of proteins linked to planar cell polarity (Inturned, Fuzzy and Wdpcp), we identified and characterized a new genetic module, which we term CPLANE (ciliogenesis and planar polarity effector), and an extensive associated protein network. CPLANE proteins physically and functionally interact with the poorly understood ciliopathy-associated protein Jbts17 at basal bodies, where they act to recruit a specific subset of IFT-A proteins. In the absence of CPLANE, defective IFT-A particles enter the axoneme and IFT-B trafficking is severely perturbed. Accordingly, mutation of CPLANE genes elicits specific ciliopathy phenotypes in mouse models and is associated with ciliopathies in human patients.},

Here we describe an approach for global detection of DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) introduced by RGNs and potentially other nucleases. This method, called genome-wide, unbiased identification of DSBs enabled by sequencing (GUIDE-seq), relies on capture of double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides into DSBs. Application of GUIDE-seq to 13 RGNs in two human cell lines revealed wide variability in RGN off-target activities and unappreciated characteristics of off-target sequences. The majority of identified sites were not detected by existing computational methods or chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). GUIDE-seq also identified RGN-independent genomic breakpoint 'hotspots'. Finally, GUIDE-seq revealed that truncated guide RNAs exhibit substantially reduced RGN-induced, off-target DSBs. Our experiments define the most rigorous framework for genome-wide identification of RGN off-target effects to date and provide a method for evaluating the safety of these nucleases before clinical use.},

Understanding how primary cilia assemble could shed light on the many human diseases caused by mutations in ciliary proteins.

Here, we report that CP110 interacts with CEP290--a protein whose deficiency is implicated in human ciliary disease--in a discrete complex separable from other CP110 complexes involved in regulating the centrosome cycle. Ablation of CEP290 prevents ciliogenesis without affecting centrosome function or cell-cycle progression. Interaction with CEP290 is absolutely required for the ability of CP110 to suppress primary cilia formation. Furthermore, CEP290 and CP110 interact with Rab8a, a small GTPase required for cilia assembly. Depletion of CEP290 interferes with localization of Rab8a to centrosomes and cilia. Our results suggest that CEP290 cooperates with Rab8a to promote ciliogenesis and that this function is antagonized by CP110.},

  abstract = {Cilia are hair-like protrusions found at the surface of most eukaryotic cells. They can be divided into two types, motile and non-motile. Motile cilia are found in a restricted number of cell types, are generally present in large numbers, and beat in a coordinated fashion to generate fluid flow or locomotion. Non-motile or primary cilia, on the other hand, are detected in many different cell types, appear once per cell, and primarily function to transmit signals from the extracellular milieu to the cell nucleus. Defects in cilia formation, function, or maintenance are known to cause a bewildering set of human diseases, or ciliopathies, typified by retinal degeneration, renal failure and cystic kidneys, obesity, liver dysfunction, and neurological disorders. A common denominator between motile and primary cilia is their structural similarity, as both types of cilia are composed of an axoneme, the ciliary backbone that is made up of microtubules emanating from a mother centriole/basal body anchored to the cell membrane, surrounded by a ciliary membrane continuous with the plasma membrane. This structural similarity is indicative of a universal mechanism of cilia assembly involving a common set of molecular players and a sophisticated, highly regulated series of molecular events. In this review, we will mainly focus on recent advances in our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying cilia assembly, with special attention paid to the centriolar protein, CP110, its interacting partner Cep290, and the various downstream molecular players and events leading to intraflagellar transport (IFT), a process that mediates the bidirectional movement of protein cargos along the axoneme and that is essential for cilia formation and maintenance.},

These modifications exhibit stereotyped patterns suggesting spatial and temporal control of microtubule functions. Using human-engineered and differentially modified microtubules we find that glutamylation is the main regulator of the hereditary spastic paraplegia microtubule severing enzyme spastin. Glutamylation acts as a rheostat and tunes microtubule severing as a function of glutamate number added per tubulin. Unexpectedly, glutamylation is a non-linear biphasic tuner and becomes inhibitory beyond a threshold. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of localized glutamylation propagates across neighboring microtubules, modulating severing in trans. Our work provides the first quantitative evidence for a graded response to a tubulin posttranslational modification and a biochemical link between tubulin glutamylation and complex architectures of microtubule arrays such as those in neurons where spastin deficiency causes disease.},

Here, we show that the MDM1 protein localizes to centrioles of dividing cells and differentiating multiciliated cells. 3D-SIM microscopy showed that MDM1 is closely associated with the centriole barrel, likely residing in the centriole lumen. Overexpression of MDM1 suppressed centriole duplication, whereas depletion of MDM1 resulted in an increase in granular material that likely represents early intermediates in centriole formation. We show that MDM1 binds microtubules in vivo and in vitro. We identified a repeat motif in MDM1 that is required for efficient microtubule binding and found that these repeats are also present in CCSAP, another microtubule-binding protein. We propose that MDM1 is a negative regulator of centriole duplication, and that its function is mediated through microtubule binding.},

  abstract = {Intraflagellar transport (IFT) is responsible for the bidirectional trafficking of molecular components required for the elongation and maintenance of eukaryotic cilia and flagella. Cargo is transported by IFT 'trains', linear rows of multiprotein particles moved by molecular motors along the axonemal doublets. We have previously described two structurally distinct categories of 'long' and 'short' trains. Here, we analyse the relative number of these trains throughout flagellar regeneration and show that long trains are most abundant at the beginning of flagellar growth whereas short trains gradually increase in number as flagella elongate. These observations are incompatible with the previous hypothesis that short trains are derived solely from the reorganization of long trains at the flagellar tip. We demonstrate with electron tomography the existence of two distinct ultrastructural organizations for the short trains, we name these 'narrow' and 'wide', and provide the first 3D model of the narrow short trains. These trains are characterized by tri-lobed units, which repeat longitudinally every 16 nm and contact protofilament 7 of the B-tubule. Functional implications of the new structural evidence are discussed.},

  abstract = {Cells release extracellular vesicles (ECVs) that play important roles in intercellular communication and may mediate a broad range of physiological and pathological processes. Many fundamental aspects of ECV biogenesis and signaling have yet to be determined, with ECV detection being a challenge and obstacle due to the small size (100 nm) of the ECVs. We developed an in vivo system to visualize the dynamic release of GFP-labeled ECVs. We show here that specific Caenorhabdidits elegans ciliated sensory neurons shed and release ECVs containing GFP-tagged polycystins LOV-1 and PKD-2. These ECVs are also abundant in the lumen surrounding the cilium. Electron tomography and genetic analysis indicate that ECV biogenesis occurs via budding from the plasma membrane at the ciliary base and not via fusion of multivesicular bodies. Intraflagellar transport and kinesin-3 KLP-6 are required for environmental release of PKD-2::GFP-containing ECVs. ECVs isolated from wild-type animals induce male tail-chasing behavior, while ECVs isolated from klp-6 animals and lacking PKD-2::GFP do not. We conclude that environmentally released ECVs play a role in animal communication and mating-related behaviors.},

Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (hereafter, Chlamydomonas), a versatile genetic model organism, has been used for several decades to exemplify the active Ci transport in eukaryotic algae, but only recently have many molecular details behind these Ci uptake systems emerged. Recent advances in genetic and molecular approaches, combined with the genome sequencing of Chlamydomonas and several other eukaryotic algae have unraveled some unique characteristics associated with the Ci uptake mechanism and the Ci-recapture system in eukaryotic microalgae. Several good candidate genes for Ci transporters in Chlamydomonas have been identified, and a few specific gene products have been linked with the Ci uptake systems associated with the different acclimation states. This review will focus on the latest studies on characterization of functional components involved in the Ci uptake and the Ci-recapture in Chlamydomonas.},

Long-day photoperiods promote FT expression activation in leaf veins specifically at dusk through the photoperiod pathway to induce Arabidopsis flowering. We found that before dusk and at night, a vascular EMF1c directly represses FT expression to prevent photoperiod-independent flowering, whereas at dusk EMF1 binding to FT chromatin is disrupted by the photoperiod pathway, leading to proper FT activation. Furthermore, a MADS-domain transcription factor and potent floral repressor binds EMF1 to repress FT expression. Our study reveals that the vascular EMF1c integrates inputs from several flowering-regulatory pathways to synchronize flowering time to environmental cues.},

At least two limiting-CO2 acclimation states, termed low CO2 and very-low CO2, have been demonstrated in the model microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and many questions still remain unanswered regarding both the regulation of these acclimation states and the molecular mechanism underlying operation of the CCM in these two states. This study examines the role of two proteins, LCIA (also named NAR1.2) and LCIB, in the CCM of C. reinhardtii. The identification of an LCIA-LCIB double mutant based on its inability to survive in very-low CO2 suggests that both LCIA and LCIB are critical for survival in very-low CO2. The contrasting impacts of individual mutations in LCIB and LCIA in comparison with the impacts of LCIB-LCIA double mutations on growth and Ci-dependent photosynthetic O2 evolution reveal distinct roles of LCIA and LCIB in the CCM. While both LCIA and LCIB are essential for very-low CO2 acclimation, LCIB appears to function in a CO2 uptake system, while LCIA appears to be associated with a HCO3- transport system. The contrasting and complementary roles of LCIA and LCIB in acclimation to low CO2 and very-low CO2 suggest a possible mechanism of differential regulation of the CCM based on the inhibition of HCO3- transporters by moderate to high levels of CO2.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intraflagellar transport (IFT) is the bidirectional movement of IFT particles between the cell body and the distal tip of a flagellum. Organized into complexes A and B, IFT particles are composed of at least 18 proteins. The function of IFT proteins in flagellar assembly has been extensively investigated. However, much less is known about the molecular mechanism of how IFT is regulated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We herein report the identification of a novel IFT particle protein, IFT25, in Chlamydomonas. Dephosphorylation assay revealed that IFT25 is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical analysis of temperature sensitive IFT mutants indicated that IFT25 is an IFT complex B subunit. In vitro binding assay confirmed that IFT25 binds to IFT27, a Rab-like small GTPase component of the IFT complex B. Immunofluorescence staining showed that IFT25 has a punctuate flagellar distribution as expected for an IFT protein, but displays a unique distribution pattern at the flagellar base. IFT25 co-localizes with IFT27 at the distal-most portion of basal bodies, probably the transition zones, and concentrates in the basal body region by partially overlapping with other IFT complex B subunits, such as IFT46. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation analysis demonstrated that, in flagella, the majority of IFT27 and IFT25 including both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms are cosedimented with other complex B subunits in the 16S fractions. In contrast, in cell body, only a fraction of IFT25 and IFT27 is integrated into the preassembled complex B, and IFT25 detected in complex B is preferentially phosphorylated. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: IFT25 is a phosphoprotein component of IFT particle complex B. IFT25 directly interacts with IFT27, and these two proteins likely form a subcomplex in vivo. We postulate that the association and disassociation between the subcomplex of IFT25 and IFT27 and complex B might be involved in the regulation of IFT.},

These factors include the formation of multiple hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions between biotin and the protein, together with the ordering of surface polypeptide loops that bury the biotin in the protein interior. Structural alterations at the biotin binding site produce quaternary changes in the streptavidin tetramer. These changes apparently propagate through cooperative deformations in the twisted beta sheets that link tetramer subunits.},

Up until recently, TFs have been the most underappreciated ciliary structures due to limited knowledge about their molecular composition and function.

Yet, how this large complex passes through the size-dependent barrier at the ciliary base remains enigmatic. Here we report that FBF1, a highly conserved transition fibre protein, is required for the ciliary import of assembled IFT particles at the ciliary base. We cloned dyf-19, the Caenorhabditis elegans homologue of human FBF1, in a whole-genome screen for ciliogenesis mutants. DYF-19 localizes specifically to transition fibres and interacts directly with the IFT-B component DYF-11/IFT54. Although not a structural component of transition fibres, DYF-19 is required for the transit of assembled IFT particles through the ciliary base. Furthermore, we found that human FBF1 shares conserved localization and function with its worm counterpart. We conclude that FBF1 is a key functional transition fibre component that actively facilitates the ciliary entry of assembled IFT machinery.},

BBS proteins form the BBSome, which binds Rabin8, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activating the Rab8 GTPase, required for ciliary assembly. We now describe serum-regulated upstream vesicular transport events leading to centrosomal Rab8 activation and ciliary membrane formation. Using live microscopy imaging, we show that upon serum withdrawal Rab8 is observed to assemble the ciliary membrane in approximately 100 min. Rab8-dependent ciliary assembly is initiated by the relocalization of Rabin8 to Rab11-positive vesicles that are transported to the centrosome. After ciliogenesis, Rab8 ciliary transport is strongly reduced, and this reduction appears to be associated with decreased Rabin8 centrosomal accumulation. Rab11-GTP associates with the Rabin8 COOH-terminal region and is required for Rabin8 preciliary membrane trafficking to the centrosome and for ciliogenesis. Using zebrafish as a model organism, we show that Rabin8 and Rab11 are associated with the BBS pathway. Finally, using tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we determined that the transport protein particle (TRAPP) II complex associates with the Rabin8 NH(2)-terminal domain and show that TRAPP II subunits colocalize with centrosomal Rabin8 and are required for Rabin8 preciliary targeting and ciliogenesis.},

  abstract = {Defects in primary cilium biogenesis underlie the ciliopathies, a growing group of genetic disorders. We describe a whole-genome siRNA-based reverse genetics screen for defects in biogenesis and/or maintenance of the primary cilium, obtaining a global resource. We identify 112 candidate ciliogenesis and ciliopathy genes, including 44 components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, 12 G-protein-coupled receptors, and 3 pre-mRNA processing factors (PRPF6, PRPF8 and PRPF31) mutated in autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. The PRPFs localize to the connecting cilium, and PRPF8- and PRPF31-mutated cells have ciliary defects. Combining the screen with exome sequencing data identified recessive mutations in PIBF1, also known as CEP90, and C21orf2, also known as LRRC76, as causes of the ciliopathies Joubert and Jeune syndromes. Biochemical approaches place C21orf2 within key ciliopathy-associated protein modules, offering an explanation for the skeletal and retinal involvement observed in individuals with C21orf2 variants. Our global, unbiased approaches provide insights into ciliogenesis complexity and identify roles for unanticipated pathways in human genetic disease.},

Each component was studied by electron microscopy and acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Purified membranes retained their tripartite ultrastructure and were shown to contain one high molecular weight protein band on electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-urea gels. Isolated mastigonemes (hairlike structures which extend laterally from the flagellar membrane in situ) were of uniform size and were constructed of ellipsoidal subunits joined end to end. Electrophoretic analysis of mastigonemes indicated that they contained a single glycoprotein of approximately 170,000 daltons The matrix fraction contained a number of proteins (particularly those of the amorphous material surrounding the microtubules), which became solubilized during membrane removal. Isolated axonemes retained the intact "9 + 2" microtubular structure and could be subfractionated by treatment with heat or detergent. Increasing concentrations of detergent solubilized axonemal microtubules in the following order: one of the two central tubules; the remaining central tubule and the outer wall of the B tubule; the remaining portions of the B tubule; the outer wall of the A tubule; the remainder of the A tubule with the exception of a ribbon of three protofilaments. These three protofilaments appeared to be the "partition" between the lumen of the A and B tubule. Electrophoretic analysis of isolated outer doublets of 9 + 2 flagella of wild-type cells and of "9 + 0" flagella of paralyzed mutants indicated that the outer doublets and central tubules were composed of two microtubule proteins (tubulins 1 and 2) Tubulins 1 and 2 were shown to have apparent molecular weights of 56,000 and 53,000 respectively},

  abstract = {Understanding the ways in which phosphorus metabolism is regulated in photosynthetic eukaryotes is critical for optimizing crop productivity and managing aquatic ecosystems in which phosphorus can be a major source of pollution. Here we describe a gene encoding a regulator of phosphorus metabolism, designated Psr1 (phosphorus starvation response), from a photosynthetic eukaryote. The Psr1 protein is critical for acclimation of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to phosphorus starvation. The N-terminal half of Psr1 contains a region similar to myb DNA-binding domains and the C-terminal half possesses glutamine-rich sequences characteristic of transcriptional activators. The level of Psr1 increases at least 10-fold upon phosphate starvation, and immunocytochemical studies demonstrate that this protein is nuclear-localized under both nutrient-replete and phosphorus-starvation conditions. Finally, Psr1 and angiosperm proteins have domains that are similar, suggesting a possible role for Psr1 homologs in the control of phosphorus metabolism in vascular plants. With the identification of regulators such as Psr1 it may become possible to engineer photosynthetic organisms for more efficient utilization of phosphorus and to establish better practices for the management of agricultural lands and natural ecosystems.},

Here, we highlight studies revealing how vitamin B12 (cobalamin)-producing bacteria increase the fitness of the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii following an increase in environmental temperature. Heat stress represses C. reinhardtii cobalamin-independent methionine synthase (METE) gene expression coinciding with a reduction in METE-mediated methionine synthase activity, chlorosis and cell death during heat stress. However, in the presence of cobalamin-producing bacteria or exogenous cobalamin amendments C. reinhardtii cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase METH-mediated methionine biosynthesis is functional at temperatures that result in C. reinhardtii death in the absence of cobalamin. Artificial microRNA silencing of C. reinhardtii METH expression leads to nearly complete loss of cobalamin-mediated enhancement of thermal tolerance. This suggests that methionine biosynthesis is an essential cellular mechanism for adaptation by C. reinhardtii to thermal stress. Increased fitness advantage of METH under environmentally stressful conditions could explain the selective pressure for retaining the METH gene in algae and the apparent independent loss of the METE gene in various algal species. Our results show that how an organism acclimates to a change in its abiotic environment depends critically on co-occurring species, the nature of that interaction, and how those species interactions evolve.},

Accurate calculation of protein surfaces is of critical importance in the protein structural and functional studies including ligand-protein docking and virtual screening. In contrast to analytical or parametric representation of macromolecular surfaces, triangulated mesh surfaces have been proved to be easy to describe, visualize and manipulate by computer programs. Here, we develop a new algorithm of EDTSurf for generating three major macromolecular surfaces of van der Waals surface, solvent-accessible surface and molecular surface, using the technique of fast Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT). The triangulated surfaces are constructed directly from volumetric solids by a Vertex-Connected Marching Cube algorithm that forms triangles from grid points. Compared to the analytical result, the relative error of the surface calculations by EDTSurf is <2-4% depending on the grid resolution, which is 1.5-4 times lower than the methods in the literature; and yet, the algorithm is faster and costs less computer memory than the comparative methods. The improvements in both accuracy and speed of the macromolecular surface determination should make EDTSurf a useful tool for the detailed study of protein docking and structure predictions. Both source code and the executable program of EDTSurf are freely available at http://zhang.bioinformatics.ku.edu/EDTSurf.},

  abstract = {Defective primary cilia are causative to a wide spectrum of human genetic disorders, termed ciliopathies. Although the regulation of ciliogenesis is intensively studied, how it is initiated remains unclear. Here we show that type Igamma phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) 5-kinase (PIPKIgamma) and inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase E (INPP5E), a Joubert syndrome protein, localize to the centrosome and coordinate the initiation of ciliogenesis. PIPKIgamma counteracts INPP5E in regulating tau-tubulin kinase-2 (TTBK2) recruitment to the basal body, which promotes the removal of microtubule capping protein CP110 and the subsequent axoneme elongation. Interestingly, INPP5E and its product-PtdIns(4)P-accumulate at the centrosome/basal body in non-ciliated, but not ciliated, cells. PtdIns(4)P binding to TTBK2 and the distal appendage protein CEP164 compromises the TTBK2-CEP164 interaction and inhibits the recruitment of TTBK2. Our results reveal that PtdIns(4)P homoeostasis, coordinated by PIPKIgamma and INPP5E at the centrosome/ciliary base, is vital for ciliogenesis by regulating the CEP164-dependent recruitment of TTBK2.},

We engineer a structure-guided endonuclease (SGN) composed of flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1), which recognizes the 3' flap structure, and the cleavage domain of Fok I (Fn1), which cleaves DNA strands. The SGN recognizes the target DNA on the basis of the 3' flap structure formed between the target and the guide DNA (gDNA) and cut the target through its Fn1 dimerization. Our results show that the SGN, guided by a pair of gDNAs, cleaves transgenic reporter gene and endogenous genes in zebrafish embryonic genome.},

  abstract = {Cilia formation and function require a special set of trafficking machinery termed intraflagellar transport (IFT), consisting mainly of protein complexes IFT-A, IFT-B, BBSome, and microtubule-dependent molecular motors. Tetratricopeptide repeat-containing (TTC) proteins are widely involved in protein complex formation. Nine of them are known to serve as components of the IFT or BBSome complexes. How many TTC proteins are cilia-related and how they function, however, remain unclear. Here we show that twenty TTC genes were upregulated by at least 2-fold during the differentiation of cultured mouse tracheal epithelial cells (MTECs) into multiciliated cells. Our systematic screen in zebrafish identified four novel TTC genes, ttc4, -9c, -36, and -39c, that are critical for cilia formation and motility. Accordingly, their zebrafish morphants displayed typical ciliopathy-related phenotypes, including curved body, abnormal otolith, hydrocephalus, and defective left-right patterning. The morphants of ttc4 and ttc25, a known cilia-related gene, additionally showed pronephric cyst formation. Immunoprecipitation indicated associations of TTC4, -9c, -25, -36, and -39c with components or entire complexes of IFT-A, IFT-B, or BBSome, implying their participations in IFT or IFT-related activities. Our results provide a global view for the relationship between TTC proteins and cilia.},

Interactions between the two fusion proteins can bring the luciferase and green fluorescent protein close enough for resonance energy transfer to occur, thus changing the color of the bioluminescent emission. By using proteins encoded by circadian (daily) clock genes from cyanobacteria, we use the BRET technique to demonstrate that the clock protein KaiB interacts to form homodimers.

  abstract = {Hair follicle morphogenesis requires precisely controlled reciprocal communications, including hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Activation of the Hh signaling pathway relies on the primary cilium. Disrupting ciliogenesis results in hair follicle morphogenesis defects due to attenuated Hh signaling; however, the loss of cilia makes it impossible to determine whether hair follicle phenotypes in these cilia mutants are caused by the loss of cilia, disruption of Hh signaling, or a combination of these events. In this study, we characterized the function of Ift27, which encodes a subunit of intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex B. Hair follicle morphogenesis of Ift27-null mice was severely impaired, reminiscent of phenotypes observed in cilia and Hh mutants. Furthermore, the Hh signaling pathway was attenuated in Ift27 mutants, which was in association with abnormal ciliary trafficking of SMO and GLI2, and impaired processing of Gli transcription factors; however, formation of the ciliary axoneme was unaffected. The ciliary localization of IFT25 (HSPB11), the binding partner of IFT27, was disrupted in Ift27 mutant cells, and Ift25-null mice displayed hair follicle phenotypes similar to those of Ift27 mutants. These data suggest that Ift27 and Ift25 operate in a genetically and functionally dependent manner during hair follicle morphogenesis. This study suggests that the molecular trafficking machineries underlying ciliogenesis and Hh signaling can be segregated, thereby providing important insights into new avenues of inhibiting Hh signaling, which might be adopted in the development of targeted therapies for Hh-dependent cancers, such as basal cell carcinoma.},

Here, we describe a "T-type" enzyme-free cloning method: instead of designing the complementary staggered overhangs used in conventional enzyme-free cloning, we create "T-type" overhangs that reduce the possibility of self-ligation and are more convenient for multi-vector cloning. In this study, we systematically optimize "T-type" enzyme-free cloning, compare its cloning background with that in conventional enzyme-free cloning, and demonstrate a promising application of this technique in multi-vector cloning. Our method simplifies post-amplification procedures and greatly reduces cost, offering a competitive option for PCR product cloning.},

  abstract = {The dynamic organization of signaling cascades inside primary cilia is key to signal propagation. Yet little is known about the dynamics of ciliary membrane proteins besides a possible role for motor-driven Intraflagellar Transport (IFT). To characterize these dynamics, we imaged single molecules of Somatostatin Receptor 3 (SSTR3, a GPCR) and Smoothened (Smo, a Hedgehog signal transducer) in the ciliary membrane. While IFT trains moved processively from one end of the cilium to the other, single SSTR3 and Smo underwent mostly diffusive behavior interspersed with short periods of directional movements. Statistical subtraction of instant velocities revealed that SSTR3 and Smo spent less than a third of their time undergoing active transport. Finally, SSTR3 and IFT movements could be uncoupled by perturbing either membrane protein diffusion or active transport. Thus ciliary membrane proteins move predominantly by diffusion, and attachment to IFT trains is transient and stochastic rather than processive or spatially determined.

We investigated the molecular function of C2 calcium-dependent domain containing 3 (C2cd3), an essential regulator of primary cilium biogenesis. We show that C2cd3 is localized to the centriolar satellites in a microtubule- and Pcm1-dependent manner; however, C2cd3 is dispensable for centriolar satellite integrity. C2cd3 is also localized to the distal ends of both mother and daughter centrioles and is required for the recruitment of five centriolar distal appendage proteins: Sclt1, Ccdc41, Cep89, Fbf1, and Cep164. Furthermore, loss of C2cd3 results in failure in the recruitment of Ttbk2 to the ciliary basal body as well as the removal of Cp110 from the ciliary basal body, two critical steps in initiating ciliogenesis. C2cd3 is also required for recruiting the intraflagellar transport proteins Ift88 and Ift52 to the mother centriole. Consistent with a role in distal appendage assembly, C2cd3 is essential for ciliary vesicle docking to the mother centriole. Our results suggest that C2cd3 regulates cilium biogenesis by promoting the assembly of centriolar distal appendages critical for docking ciliary vesicles and recruiting other essential ciliogenic proteins.},

The new mCherry TriFC systems were successfully used to image RNA-protein interactions such as that between influenza viral protein NS1 and the 5' UTR of influenza viral mRNAs NS, M, and NP. Upon combination of an mCherry TriFC system with a Venus TriFC system, multiple mRNA-protein interactions could be detected simultaneously in the same cells. Then, the new mCherry TriFC system was used for imaging of interactions between influenza A virus mRNAs and some of adapter proteins in cellular TAP nuclear export pathway in live cells. Adapter proteins Aly and UAP56 were found to associate with three kinds of viral mRNAs. Another adapter protein, splicing factor 9G8, only interacted with intron-containing spliced M2 mRNA. Co-immunoprecipitation assays with influenza A virus-infected cells confirmed these interactions. This study provides long-wavelength-spectrum TriFC systems as new tools for visualizing RNA-protein interactions in live cells and help to understand the nuclear export mechanism of influenza A viral mRNAs.},

These samples were obtained by throat swabs of adults without a psychiatric disorder or serious physical illness who were participating in a study that included measures of cognitive functioning.

The presence of ATCV-1 DNA was not associated with demographic variables but was associated with a modest but statistically significant decrease in the performance on cognitive assessments of visual processing and visual motor speed. We further explored the effects of ATCV-1 in a mouse model. The inoculation of ATCV-1 into the intestinal tract of 9-11-wk-old mice resulted in a subsequent decrease in performance in several cognitive domains, including ones involving recognition memory and sensory-motor gating. ATCV-1 exposure in mice also resulted in the altered expression of genes within the hippocampus.

Partial loss of IFT80 function leads Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD) or short-rib polydactyly (SRP) syndrome type III, displaying narrow thoracic cavity and multiple cartilage anomalies. However, it is unknown how IFT80 regulates cartilage formation. To define the role and mechanism of IFT80 in chondrocyte function and cartilage formation, we generated a Col2alpha1; IFT80f/f mouse model by crossing IFT80f/f mice with inducible Col2alpha1-CreER mice, and deleted IFT80 in chondrocyte lineage by injection of tamoxifen into the mice in embryonic or postnatal stage. Loss of IFT80 in the embryonic stage resulted in short limbs at birth. Histological studies showed that IFT80-deficient mice have shortened cartilage with marked changes in cellular morphology and organization in the resting, proliferative, pre-hypertrophic, and hypertrophic zones. Moreover, deletion of IFT80 in the postnatal stage led to mouse stunted growth with shortened growth plate but thickened articular cartilage. Defects of ciliogenesis were found in the cartilage of IFT80-deficient mice and primary IFT80-deficient chondrocytes. Further study showed that chondrogenic differentiation was significantly inhibited in IFT80-deficient mice due to reduced hedgehog (Hh) signaling and increased Wnt signaling activities. These findings demonstrate that loss of IFT80 blocks chondrocyte differentiation by disruption of ciliogenesis and alteration of Hh and Wnt signaling transduction, which in turn alters epiphyseal and articular cartilage formation.},

Cpf1 is a single RNA-guided endonuclease lacking tracrRNA, and it utilizes a T-rich protospacer-adjacent motif. Moreover, Cpf1 cleaves DNA via a staggered DNA double-stranded break.

  abstract = {SUMOs are small ubiquitin-related polypeptides that are reversibly conjugated to many nuclear proteins. Although the number of identified substrates has grown rapidly, relatively little is still understood about when, where, and why most proteins are modified by SUMO. Here, we demonstrate that enzymes involved in the SUMO modification and demodification of proteins are components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). We show that SENP2, a SUMO protease that is able to demodify both SUMO-1 and SUMO-2 or SUMO-3 protein conjugates, localizes to the nucleoplasmic face of the NPC. The unique amino-terminal domain of SENP2 interacts with the FG repeat domain of Nup153, indicating that SENP2 associates with the nucleoplasmic basket of the NPC. We also investigated the localization of the SUMO conjugating enzyme, Ubc9. Using immunogold labeling of isolated nuclear envelopes, we found that Ubc9 localizes to both the cytoplasmic and the nucleoplasmic filaments of the NPC. In vitro binding studies revealed that Ubc9 and SUMO-1-modified RanGAP1 bind synergistically to form a trimeric complex with a component of the cytoplasmic filaments of the NPC, Nup358. Our results indicate that both SUMO modification and demodification of proteins may occur at the NPC and suggest a connection between the SUMO modification pathway and nucleocytoplasmic transport.},

  abstract = {Endocytic trafficking is a highly organized process regulated by a network of proteins, including the Rab family of small GTP-binding proteins and the C-terminal EHDs (Eps15 homology-domain-containing proteins). Central roles for Rab proteins have been described in vesicle budding, delivery, tethering and fusion, whereas little is known about the functions of EHDs in membrane transport. Common effectors for these two protein families have been identified, and they facilitate regulation of sequential steps in transport. By comparing and contrasting key aspects in their modes of function, we shall promote a better understanding of how Rab proteins and EHDs regulate endocytic trafficking.},

  abstract = {Raman-activated cell sorting (RACS) is a promising single-cell technology that holds several significant advantages, as RACS is label-free, information-rich, and potentially in situ. To date, the ability of the technique to identify single cells in a high-speed flow has been limited by inherent weakness of the spontaneous Raman signal. Here we present an alternative pause-and-sort RACS microfluidic system that combines positive dielectrophoresis (pDEP) for single-cell trap and release with a solenoid-valve-suction-based switch for cell separation. This has allowed the integration of trapping, Raman identification, and automatic separation of individual cells in a high-speed flow. By exerting a periodical pDEP field, single cells were trapped, ordered, and positioned individually to the detection point for Raman measurement. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, a mixture of two cell strains containing carotenoid-producing yeast (9%) and non-carotenoid-producing Saccharomyces cerevisiae (91%) was sorted, which enriched the former to 73% on average and showed a fast Raman-activated cell sorting at the subsecond level.},

Here, we present ChlaMmeSeq (Chlamydomonas MmeI-based insertion site Sequencing), a tool for simultaneous mapping of tens of thousands of mutagenic insertion sites in the eukaryotic unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We first validated ChlaMmeSeq by in-depth characterization of individual insertion sites. We then applied ChlaMmeSeq to a mutant pool and mapped 11,478 insertions, covering 39% of annotated protein coding genes. We observe that insertions are distributed in a manner largely indistinguishable from random, indicating that mutants in nearly all genes can be obtained efficiently. The data reveal that sequence-specific endonucleolytic activities cleave the transforming DNA and allow us to propose a simple model to explain the origin of the poorly understood exogenous sequences that sometimes surround insertion sites. ChlaMmeSeq is quantitatively reproducible, enabling its use for pooled enrichment screens and for the generation of indexed mutant libraries. Additionally, ChlaMmeSeq allows genotyping of hits from Chlamydomonas screens on an unprecedented scale, opening the door to comprehensive identification of genes with roles in photosynthesis, algal lipid metabolism, the algal carbon-concentrating mechanism, phototaxis, the biogenesis and function of cilia, and other processes for which C. reinhardtii is a leading model system.},

Radiographic abnormalities include undermineralization of the calvarium, shortened and bowed appendicular bones, trident shaped acetabula and polydactyly. In a case of SRPS we identified compound heterozygosity for mutations in IFT52, which encodes a component of the anterograde intraflagellar transport complex. The IFT52 mutant cells synthesized a significantly reduced amount of IFT52 protein, leading to reduced synthesis of IFT74, IFT81, IFT88 and ARL13B, other key anterograde complex members. Ciliogenesis was also disrupted in the mutant cells, with a 60% reduction in the presence of cilia on mutant cells and loss of cilia length regulation for the cells with cilia. These data demonstrate that IFT52 is essential for anterograde complex integrity and for the biosynthesis and maintenance of cilia. The data identify a new locus for SRPS and show that IFT52 mutations result in a ciliopathy with primary effects on the skeleton.},

The application of genome-scale RNAi relies on the development of high-quality RNAi HTS assays. To obtain high-quality HTS assays, there is a strong need for an easily interpretable and theoretically based quality control (QC) metric. Signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), signal-to-background ratio (S/B), and Z-factor have been adopted as QC metrics in HTS assays. In this paper, I proposed a pair of new parameters, strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD) and coefficient of variability in difference (CVD), as QC metrics in RNAi HTS assays. Compared to S/B and S/N, SSMD and CVD capture the variabilities in both compared populations. Compared to Z-factor, SSMD and CVD have a clear probability interpretation and a solid statistical basis. Accordingly, the cutoff criteria of using SSMD or CVD as a QC metric in HTS assays are fully theoretically based. In addition, I discuss the relationship between the SSMD-based criterion and the popular Z-factor-based criterion and elucidate why p-value from t-test of testing mean difference fails to serve as a QC metric.},

The completion of the Chlamydomonas genome sequence makes it possible to use reverse genetic approaches in this organism. Chlamydomonas contains a set of endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs) that down-regulate their target gene expression through mRNA cleavage. Here we developed an artificial miRNA-based strategy to knock down gene expression in Chlamydomonas. Using an endogenous Chlamydomonas miRNA precursor as the backbone, we constructed two artificial miRNAs (amiRNAs) targeting the MAA7 and RBCS1/2 genes, respectively. When overexpressed, these two amiRNAs could cleave their respective targets precisely at the predicted sites, resulting in greatly decreased accumulation of MAA7 and RBCS1/2 transcripts and expected mutant phenotypes. We further showed that the two amiRNAs could be produced simultaneously from a dimeric amiRNA precursor. We anticipate that the amiRNA technology developed in this study will be very useful in assessing the functions of individual genes and in genome-wide approaches.},

At stages during each procedure, the lipid compositions of the cells were determined, and the thermotropic lipid phase transitions were observed in whole cell culture by fluorescence assay with the hydrophobic probe N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine. Competence was evaluated by determining transformation efficiencies with plasmid pBR322 DNA. The competence-inducing procedures effected only slight changes in phospholipid compositions which did not correlate with transformability. However, the induction of competence was coincident with de novo synthesis and incorporation of poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate into the cytoplasmic membranes and with the appearance of a sharp lipid phase transition above physiological temperatures. Transformation efficiencies correlated with poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations and with the intensity of the new phase transition. Transformability, poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate synthesis and the new phase transition were not significantly affected by inhibition of protein synthesis with chloramphenicol or inhibition of respiration or ATP synthesis with azide, cyanide, arsenate, or 2,4-dinitrophenol; however, when poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate synthesis was inhibited with acetaldehyde, the new phase transition was not observed, and competence failed to develop. These studies suggest that genetic transformability in E. coli may be physiologically regulated.},

The protocol was optimized using factorial design techniques across variables that included PHB molecular weight and concentration, DMSO concentration, monovalent and divalent salts, glucose, cold and heat shocks, cell density, and pH. Using 10 ng DNA, the optimized protocol produces approximately 1000 colony-forming units (CFUs) from 100 microL early log-phase cell culture or approximately 300 CFU from a 21-24 h single colony, sufficient for many applications. The total volume of the transformation reaction mixture is only 150 microL suggesting that the procedure may be adapted for use in microplates or automated transformation technologies.},

  abstract = {The molecular mechanisms that activate expression of zygote genes after fertilization are obscure. In animals, receptor-ligand interactions during sperm-egg membrane fusion as well as delivery of putative regulatory molecules by the sperm into the egg cytoplasm are proposed to activate zygote development and subsequent transcription of zygote genes. The mechanisms of activation of zygote development in higher plants also are mysterious, in part because of the difficulty of isolating female gametes of higher plants. In the unicellular, biflagellated green alga Chlamydomonas, the early steps in zygote development are much more accessible to investigation. Within minutes after mating type plus (mt+) and mating type minus (mt-) gametes fuse, expression of several zygote-specific transcripts is induced independently of protein synthesis. Here, we show that ectopic expression in mt- gametes of an mt+ gamete-specific, homeodomain protein, GSP1, induces a zygote-like phenotype and activates expression of zygote genes. One of the genes, zsp2, expressed in these "haploid zygotes" encodes a zygote cell surface adhesion molecule that promotes formation of multicellular aggregates. In total, expression of six out of seven zygote genes examined was induced by ectopic expression of GSP1. Our experiments show that in addition to contributing their genomes to the zygote cytoplasm, gametes also deliver proteins that can activate gene transcription.},

Furthermore, we demonstrate its interaction with the golgin GM130 and its localization to the Golgi. The VPS15-R998Q patient mutation impairs Golgi trafficking functions in humanized yeast cells. Moreover, in VPS15-R998Q patient fibroblasts, the intraflagellar transport protein IFT20 is not localized to vesicles trafficking to the cilium but is restricted to the Golgi. Our findings suggest that at the Golgi, VPS15 and GM130 form a protein complex devoid of VPS34 to ensure the IFT20-dependent sorting and transport of membrane proteins from the cis-Golgi to the primary cilium.},

  abstract = {Cilia and extracellular vesicles (EVs) are signaling organelles [1]. Cilia act as cellular sensory antennae, with defects resulting in human ciliopathies. Cilia both release and bind to EVs [1]. EVs are sub-micron-sized particles released by cells and function in both short- and long-range intercellular communication. In C. elegans and mammals, the autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) gene products polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 localize to both cilia and EVs, act in the same genetic pathway, and function in a sensory capacity, suggesting ancient conservation [2]. A fundamental understanding of EV biology and the relationship between the polycystins, cilia, and EVs is lacking. To define properties of a ciliated EV-releasing cell, we performed RNA-seq on 27 GFP-labeled EV-releasing neurons (EVNs) isolated from adult C. elegans. We identified 335 significantly overrepresented genes, of which 61 were validated by GFP reporters. The EVN transcriptional profile uncovered new pathways controlling EV biogenesis and polycystin signaling and also identified EV cargo, which included an antimicrobial peptide and ASIC channel. Tumor-necrosis-associated factor (TRAF) homologs trf-1 and trf-2 and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pmk-1 acted in polycystin-signaling pathways controlling male mating behaviors. pmk-1 was also required for EV biogenesis, independent of the innate immunity MAPK signaling cascade. This first high-resolution transcriptome profile of a subtype of ciliated sensory neurons isolated from adult animals reveals the functional components of an EVN.},

  abstract = {Primary and motile cilia/flagella function as cellular antennae, receiving signals from the environment and subsequently activating signaling pathways that are critical for cellular homeostasis and differentiation [1-3]. Recent work with the green alga Chlamydomonas and the nematode C. elegans demonstrated that ectosomes can be released from the cilium and can mediate the intercellular communication [4-9]. To better understand the function of flagellar ectosomes, we have compared their protein composition to that of the flagellar membrane from which they are derived. Ectosomes released from flagella have a unique protein composition, being enriched in a subset of flagellar membrane proteins, proteases, proteins from the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) [10-12], small GTPases, and ubiquitinated proteins. Live imaging showed that an ESCRT-related protein (PDCD6) was enriched in ectosomes released from flagella during gamete activation. We devised a sensitive and rapid assay to monitor ectosome release using luciferase fused to PDCD6 and a mutated ubiquitin. Ectosome release increased when cells underwent flagellar resorption. Knockdown of two ESCRT-related proteins, PDCD6 and VPS4, attenuated ectosome release during flagellar shortening and shortening was slowed. These data suggest that the ESCRT proteins mediate ectosome release and thereby influence flagellar shortening in Chlamydomonas. In addition, the prevalence of receptors such as agglutinin and ubiquitinated proteins in ciliary ectosomes suggests that they are involved in cell signaling and turnover of ciliary proteins.},

  abstract = {Cilia are sensory organelles that protrude from cell surfaces to monitor the surrounding environment. In addition to its role as sensory receiver, the cilium also releases extracellular vesicles (EVs). The release of sub-micron sized EVs is a conserved form of intercellular communication used by all three kingdoms of life. These extracellular organelles play important roles in both short and long range signaling between donor and target cells and may coordinate systemic responses within an organism in normal and diseased states. EV shedding from ciliated cells and EV-cilia interactions are evolutionarily conserved phenomena, yet remarkably little is known about the relationship between the cilia and EVs and the fundamental biology of EVs. Studies in the model organisms Chlamydomonas and Caenorhabditis elegans have begun to shed light on ciliary EVs. Chlamydomonas EVs are shed from tips of flagella and are bioactive. Caenorhabditis elegans EVs are shed and released by ciliated sensory neurons in an intraflagellar transport-dependent manner. Caenorhabditis elegans EVs play a role in modulating animal-to-animal communication, and this EV bioactivity is dependent on EV cargo content. Some ciliary pathologies, or ciliopathies, are associated with abnormal EV shedding or with abnormal cilia-EV interactions. Until the 21st century, both cilia and EVs were ignored as vestigial or cellular junk. As research interest in these two organelles continues to gain momentum, we envision a new field of cell biology emerging. Here, we propose that the cilium is a dedicated organelle for EV biogenesis and EV reception. We will also discuss possible mechanisms by which EVs exert bioactivity and explain how what is learned in model organisms regarding EV biogenesis and function may provide insight to human ciliopathies.},

  abstract = {The investigation of Caenorhabditis elegans males and the male-specific sensory neurons required for mating behaviors has provided insight into the molecular function of polycystins and mechanisms that are needed for polycystin ciliary localization. In humans, polycystin 1 and polycystin 2 are needed for kidney function; loss of polycystin function leads to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Polycystins localize to cilia in C. elegans and mammals, a finding that has guided research into ADPKD. The discovery that the polycystins form ciliary receptors in male-specific neurons needed for mating behaviors has also helped to unlock insights into two additional exciting new areas: the secretion of extracellular vesicles; and mechanisms of ciliary specialization. First, we will summarize the studies done in C. elegans regarding the expression, localization, and function of the polycystin 1 and 2 homologs, LOV-1 and PKD-2, and discuss insights gained from this basic research. Molecules that are co-expressed with the polycystins in the male-specific neurons may identify evolutionarily conserved molecular mechanisms for polycystin function and localization. We will discuss the finding that polycystins are secreted in extracellular vesicles that evoke behavioral change in males, suggesting that such vesicles provide a novel form of communication to conspecifics in the environment. In humans, polycystin-containing extracellular vesicles are secreted in urine and can be taken up by cilia, and quickly internalized. Therefore, communication by polycystin-containing extracellular vesicles may also use mechanisms that are evolutionarily conserved from nematode to human. Lastly, different cilia display structural and functional differences that specialize them for particular tasks, despite the fact that virtually all cilia are built by a conserved intraflagellar transport (IFT) mechanism and share some basic structural features. Comparative analysis of the male-specific cilia with the well-studied cilia of the amphid and phasmid neurons has allowed identification of molecules that specialize the male cilia. We will discuss the molecules that shape the male-specific cilia. The cell biology of cilia in male-specific neurons demonstrates that C. elegans can provide an excellent model of ciliary specialization.},

PC1+ vesicles surround cilia in Pkhd1(del2/del2) mice, which led us to analyze these structures in detail. We subfractionated urinary exosome-like vesicles (ELVs) and isolated a subpopulation abundant in polycystin-1, fibrocystin (in their cleaved forms), and polycystin-2. This removed Tamm-Horsfall protein, the major contaminant, and subfractionated ELVs into at least three different populations, demarcated by the presence of aquaporin-2, polycystin-1, and podocin. Proteomic analysis of PKD ELVs identified 552 proteins (232 not yet in urinary proteomic databases), many of which have been implicated in signaling, including the molecule Smoothened. We also detected two other protein products of genes involved in cystic disease: Cystin, the product of the mouse cpk locus, and ADP-ribosylation factor-like 6, the product of the human Bardet-Biedl syndrome gene (BBS3). Our proteomic analysis confirmed that cleavage of polycystin-1 and fibrocystin occurs in vivo, in manners consistent with cleavage at the GPS site in polycystin-1 and the proprotein convertase site in fibrocystin. In vitro, these PKD ELVs preferentially interacted with primary cilia of kidney and biliary epithelial cells in a rapid and highly specific manner. These data suggest that PKD proteins are shed in membrane particles in the urine, and these particles interact with primary cilia.},

Moreover, these apical midbodies are released, as a whole or in part, into the extracellular space, yielding the prominin-1-enriched membrane particles found in the neural tube fluid. The primary cilium of neuroepithelial cells also concentrates prominin-1 and appears to be a second source of the prominin-1-bearing extracellular membrane particles.

  abstract = {Intercellular protein-protein interactions (PPIs) enable communication between cells in diverse biological processes, including cell proliferation, immune responses, infection, and synaptic transmission, but they are challenging to visualize because existing techniques have insufficient sensitivity and/or specificity. Here we report a split horseradish peroxidase (sHRP) as a sensitive and specific tool for the detection of intercellular PPIs. The two sHRP fragments, engineered through screening of 17 cut sites in HRP followed by directed evolution, reconstitute into an active form when driven together by an intercellular PPI, producing bright fluorescence or contrast for electron microscopy. Fusing the sHRP fragments to the proteins neurexin (NRX) and neuroligin (NLG), which bind each other across the synaptic cleft, enabled sensitive visualization of synapses between specific sets of neurons, including two classes of synapses in the mouse visual system. sHRP should be widely applicable to studying mechanisms of communication between a variety of cell types.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The CRISPR-Cas9 system is a widely utilized platform for transgenic animal production in various species, although its off-target effects should be addressed. Several applications of this tool have been proposed in model animals but remain insufficient for transgenic livestock production. RESULTS: Here, we report the first application of single Cas9 nickase (Cas9n) to induce gene insertion at a selected locus in cattle. We identify the main binding sites of a catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) protein in bovine fetal fibroblast cells (BFFs) with chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). Subsequently, we demonstrate that a single Cas9n-induced single-strand break can stimulate the insertion of the natural resistance-associated macrophage protein-1 (NRAMP1) gene with reduced, but still considerable, off-target effects. Through somatic cell nuclear transfer, we finally obtain transgenic cattle with increased resistance to tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results contribute to the development of CRISPR-Cas9 system for agriculture applications.},

In vitro biochemical analysis shows that C2c2 is guided by a single CRISPR RNA and can be programmed to cleave single-stranded RNA targets carrying complementary protospacers. In bacteria, C2c2 can be programmed to knock down specific mRNAs. Cleavage is mediated by catalytic residues in the two conserved Higher Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes Nucleotide-binding (HEPN) domains, mutations of which generate catalytically inactive RNA-binding proteins. These results broaden our understanding of CRISPR-Cas systems and suggest that C2c2 can be used to develop new RNA-targeting tools.},

The two RNase catalytic pockets responsible for cleaving pre-crRNA and target RNA are independently located on Helical-1 and HEPN domains, respectively. crRNA binding induces significant conformational changes that are likely to stabilize crRNA binding and facilitate target RNA recognition.

  abstract = {Microbial CRISPR-Cas systems are divided into Class 1, with multisubunit effector complexes, and Class 2, with single protein effectors. Currently, only two Class 2 effectors, Cas9 and Cpf1, are known. We describe here three distinct Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems. The effectors of two of the identified systems, C2c1 and C2c3, contain RuvC-like endonuclease domains distantly related to Cpf1. The third system, C2c2, contains an effector with two predicted HEPN RNase domains. Whereas production of mature CRISPR RNA (crRNA) by C2c1 depends on tracrRNA, C2c2 crRNA maturation is tracrRNA independent. We found that C2c1 systems can mediate DNA interference in a 5'-PAM-dependent fashion analogous to Cpf1. However, unlike Cpf1, which is a single-RNA-guided nuclease, C2c1 depends on both crRNA and tracrRNA for DNA cleavage. Finally, comparative analysis indicates that Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems evolved on multiple occasions through recombination of Class 1 adaptation modules with effector proteins acquired from distinct mobile elements.},

Most organisms evolved several distinct yet interacting strategies of anti-pathogen defense including resistance to parasite invasion, innate and adaptive immunity, and programmed cell death (PCD). The PCD is the means of last resort, a suicidal response to infection that is activated when resistance and immunity fail. An infected cell faces a decision between active defense and altruistic suicide or dormancy induction, depending on whether immunity is "deemed" capable of preventing parasite reproduction and consequent infection of other cells. In bacteria and archaea, immunity genes typically colocalize with PCD modules, such as toxins-antitoxins, suggestive of immunity-PCD coupling, likely mediated by shared proteins that sense damage and "predict" the outcome of infections. In type VI CRISPR-Cas systems, the same enzyme that inactivates the target RNA might execute cell suicide, in a case of ultimate integration of immunity and PCD.},

Initially, the fl agellum grows at a constant rate (50 nm/min) when shorter than 1500 nm. The growth rate decays sharply when the fl agellum grows longer, which decreases to ~9 nm/min at 7500 nm. We modeled fl agellin transport inside the channel as a one-dimensional diffusive process with an injection force at its base. When the fl agellum is short, its growth rate is determined by the loading speed at the base. Only when the fl agellum grows longer does diffusion of fl agellin become the rate-limiting step, dramatically reducing the growth rate.

  abstract = {Signaling receptors dynamically exit cilia upon activation of signaling pathways such as Hedgehog. Here, we find that when activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) fail to undergo BBSome-mediated retrieval from cilia back into the cell, these GPCRs concentrate into membranous buds at the tips of cilia before release into extracellular vesicles named ectosomes. Unexpectedly, actin and the actin regulators drebrin and myosin 6 mediate ectosome release from the tip of cilia. Mirroring signal-dependent retrieval, signal-dependent ectocytosis is a selective and effective process that removes activated signaling molecules from cilia. Congruently, ectocytosis compensates for BBSome defects as ectocytic removal of GPR161, a negative regulator of Hedgehog signaling, permits the appropriate transduction of Hedgehog signals in Bbs mutants. Finally, ciliary receptors that lack retrieval determinants such as the anorexigenic GPCR NPY2R undergo signal-dependent ectocytosis in wild-type cells. Our data show that signal-dependent ectocytosis regulates ciliary signaling in physiological and pathological contexts.},

However, methanol was lethal to cells in the presence of light. Frozen cultures became non-viable within 24 h when stored at ?80°C, whereas those stored below ?130°C remained viable for at least several months. Highest viability was attained in cultures that were frozen and stored at a low cell density. High viability also required that frozen cultures be warmed rapidly and the cryoprotective agent removed immediately thereafter in preparation for culturing in liquid or on solid medium. Individual cell viability was determined by measurements of colony counts after cell plating and by the penetration of Evans blue dye into non-viable cells. Viability in bulk culture was conveniently measured by comparing the rates of photosynthetic oxygen evolution, corrected for dark respiration, in previously frozen cultures with the corresponding rates in unfrozen controls. Cultures that had lost viability as measured by a decline in whole-cell photosynthetic oxygen evolution after freezing and thawing retained functional Photosystem II activity for some time thereafter, indicating that the loss in photosynthetic activity was due to some process other than photoinhibition of Photosystem II.},

  abstract = {Cryopreservation is a practical method for stabilizing the genetic content of living algae over long periods of time. Yet, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the algal species most often utilized in studies requiring genetically defined strains, is difficult to cryopreserve with a consistently high post-thaw viability. Work described here demonstrates that C. reinhardtii retains high viability only when cryopreserved at a low cell density. Low viability at high cell density was caused by the release of an injurious substance into the culture medium. Rapid freezing and thawing under non-cryoprotective conditions released large amounts of the injurious substance. Heat denaturation of cells prevented the release of the injurious substance, but heating did not inactivate it after it was released. Even when concentrated, the injurious substance was non-toxic to cells under normal culture conditions. Reduced viability of cells cryopreserved in the presence of the injurious substance could not be attributed to changes in the tonicity of the medium. A mutant strain of C. reinhardtii (cw10) with a greatly diminished cell wall did not release a substance that reduced the post-thaw viability of wild-type or cw10 cryopreserved cells. Cryopreservation of cw10 cells was achieved with approximately the same post-thaw viability irrespective to the cell concentration at the time of freezing. Acid treatment of the injurious substance was able to partially diminish its injurious effect on cells during cryopreservation. We propose that diminished viability of C. reinhardtii cells cryopreserved at high cell densities is caused by the enzymatic release of a cell-wall component.},

To assess the working mechanism of the IFT-A complex in IFT and ciliogenesis, we have analyzed ift43 mutants of Chlamydomnonas in conjunction with mutants of the other IFT-A subunits. An ift43 null mutant or a mutant with a partial deletion of the IFT43 conserved domain has no or short flagella. The mutants accumulate not only IFT-B but also IFT-Ain the short flagella, which is in contrast to an ift140 null mutant. The IFT43 conserved domain is necessary and sufficient for the function of IFT43. IFT43 directly interacts with IFT121 and loss of IFT43 results in instability of IFT-A. A construct with a partial deletion of the IFT43 conserved domain is sufficient to rescue the instability phenotype of IFT-A, but results in diminishing of IFT-A at the peri-basal body region. We have further provided evidence for the direct interactions within the IFT-A complex and shown that the integrity of IFT-A is important for its stability and cellular localization. Finally, we show that both IFT43 and IFT140 are involved in mobilizing ciliary precursors from the cytoplasmic pool during flagellar regeneration, suggesting a novel role of IFT-A in transporting ciliary components in the cytoplasm to the peri-basal body region.},

  abstract = {Several proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) localize to cilia. Furthermore, cilia are malformed in mice with PKD with mutations in TgN737Rpw (encoding polaris). It is not known, however, whether ciliary dysfunction occurs or is relevant to cyst formation in PKD. Here, we show that polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), proteins respectively encoded by Pkd1 and Pkd2, mouse orthologs of genes mutated in human autosomal dominant PKD, co-distribute in the primary cilia of kidney epithelium. Cells isolated from transgenic mice that lack functional PC1 formed cilia but did not increase Ca(2+) influx in response to physiological fluid flow. Blocking antibodies directed against PC2 similarly abolished the flow response in wild-type cells as did inhibitors of the ryanodine receptor, whereas inhibitors of G-proteins, phospholipase C and InsP(3) receptors had no effect. These data suggest that PC1 and PC2 contribute to fluid-flow sensation by the primary cilium in renal epithelium and that they both function in the same mechanotransduction pathway. Loss or dysfunction of PC1 or PC2 may therefore lead to PKD owing to the inability of cells to sense mechanical cues that normally regulate tissue morphogenesis.},

  abstract = {Cilia assembly and disassembly are coupled to actin dynamics, ensuring a coherent cellular response during environmental change. How these processes are integrated remains undefined. The histone lysine demethylase KDM3A plays important roles in organismal homeostasis. Loss-of-function mouse models of Kdm3a phenocopy features associated with human ciliopathies, whereas human somatic mutations correlate with poor cancer prognosis. We demonstrate that absence of KDM3A facilitates ciliogenesis, but these resulting cilia have an abnormally wide range of axonemal lengths, delaying disassembly and accumulating intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins. KDM3A plays a dual role by regulating actin gene expression and binding to the actin cytoskeleton, creating a responsive "actin gate" that involves ARP2/3 activity and IFT. Promoting actin filament formation rescues KDM3A mutant ciliary defects. Conversely, the simultaneous depolymerization of actin networks and IFT overexpression mimics the abnormal ciliary traits of KDM3A mutants. KDM3A is thus a negative regulator of ciliogenesis required for the controlled recruitment of IFT proteins into cilia through the modulation of actin dynamics.},

The motility of cilia relies on a number of large protein complexes including the force-generating outer dynein arms (ODAs). The transport of ODAs into cilia has been previously shown to require the transport adaptor ODA16 as well as the intraflagellar transport (IFT) protein IFT46, but the molecular mechanism by which ODAs are recognized and transported into motile cilia is still unclear. Here, we determined the high-resolution crystal structure of C. reinhardtii ODA16 (CrODA16) and mapped the binding to IFT46 and ODAs. The CrODA16 structure revealed a small 80-residue N-terminal domain and a C-terminal 8-bladed β-propeller domain that are both required for the association with the N-terminal 147 residues of IFT46. The dissociation constant of the IFT46-ODA16 complex was 200 nM, demonstrating that CrODA16 associates with the IFT complex with an affinity comparable to that of the individual IFT subunits. Furthermore, we show, using ODAs extracted from the axonemes of C. reinhardtii, that the C-terminal β-propeller but not the N-terminal domain of CrODA16 is required for the interaction with ODAs. These data allowed us to present an architectural model for ODA16-mediated IFT of ODAs.},

  abstract = {The microtubule (MT) plus-end tracking protein EB1 is present at the tips of cilia and flagella; end-binding protein 1 (EB1) remains at the tip during flagellar shortening and in the absence of intraflagellar transport (IFT), the predominant protein transport system in flagella. To investigate how EB1 accumulates at the flagellar tip, we used in vivo imaging of fluorescent protein-tagged EB1 (EB1-FP) in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. After photobleaching, the EB1 signal at the flagellar tip recovered within minutes, indicating an exchange with unbleached EB1 entering the flagella from the cell body. EB1 moved independent of IFT trains, and EB1-FP recovery did not require the IFT pathway. Single-particle imaging showed that EB1-FP is highly mobile along the flagellar shaft and displays a markedly reduced mobility near the flagellar tip. Individual EB1-FP particles dwelled for several seconds near the flagellar tip, suggesting the presence of stable EB1 binding sites. In simulations, the two distinct phases of EB1 mobility are sufficient to explain its accumulation at the tip. We propose that proteins uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm like EB1 accumulate locally by diffusion and capture; IFT, in contrast, might be required to transport proteins against cellular concentration gradients into or out of cilia.},

Recent in vitro studies have suggested that, together, the calponin-homology domain within the IFT81 N-terminus and the highly basic N-terminus of IFT74 form a module for IFT of tubulin. By using Chlamydomonas mutants for IFT81 and IFT74, we tested this hypothesis in vivo Modification of the predicted tubulin-binding residues in IFT81 did not significantly affect basic anterograde IFT and length of steady-state flagella but slowed down flagellar regeneration, a phenotype similar to that seen in a strain that lacks the IFT74 N-terminus. In both mutants, the frequency of tubulin transport by IFT was greatly reduced. A double mutant that combined the modifications to IFT81 and IFT74 was able to form only very short flagella. These results indicate that, together, the IFT81 and IFT74 N-termini are crucial for flagellar assembly, and are likely to function as the main module for IFT of tubulin.},

Ciliary defects are associated with a class of cilia-related diseases or developmental disorders, termed ciliopathies. Even though the presence of cilia is required for diverse functions, cilia can be removed through ciliary shortening or resorption that necessitates disassembly of the cilium, which occurs normally during cell cycle progression, cell differentiation and in response to cellular stress. The functional significance of ciliary resorption is highlighted in controlling the G1-S transition during cell cycle progression. Internal or external cues that trigger ciliary resorption initiate signaling cascades that regulate several downstream events including depolymerization of axonemal microtubules, dynamic changes in actin and the ciliary membrane, regulation of intraflagellar transport and posttranslational modifications of ciliary proteins. To ensure ciliary resorption, both the active disassembly of the cilium and the simultaneous inhibition of ciliary assembly must be coordinately regulated.},

The ciliary functions of Nrks are mostly revealed by genetic studies; however, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we show that a Chlamydomonas Nrk, CNK4, regulates ciliary stability and length. CNK4 is localized to the basal body region and the flagella. The cnk4-null mutant exhibited long flagella, with formation of flagellar bulges. The flagella gradually became curled at the bulge formation site, leading to flagellar loss. Electron microscopy shows that the curled flagella involved curling and degeneration of axonemal microtubules. cnk4 mutation resulted in flagellar increases of IFT trains, as well as its accumulation at the flagellar bulges. IFT speeds were not affected, however, IFT trains frequently stalled, leading to reduced IFT frequencies. These data are consistent with a model in which CNK4 regulates microtubule dynamics and IFT to control flagellar stability and length.},

Here, we define the cellular mechanisms that bring about shortening of flagella prior to meiotic cell division and in response to environmental cues in the biflagellated green alga Chlamydomonas. We show that the flagellar shortening pathway is distinct from the one that enforces transient shortening essential for length control. During flagellar shortening, disassembly of the axoneme is stimulated over the basal rate, and the rate of entry into flagella of intraflagellar transport (IFT) particles is increased. Moreover, the particles entering the disassembling flagella lack cargo. Thus, flagellar shortening depends on the interplay between dynamic properties of the axoneme and the IFT machinery; a cell triggered to shorten its flagellum activates disassembly of the axoneme and stimulates entry into the flagellum of IFT particles possessing empty cargo binding sites available to retrieve the disassembled components.},

Mechanistic models proposed for flagellar length regulation have been constrained by the assumption that flagella are static structures once they are assembled. However, recent work has shown that flagella are dynamic and are constantly turning over. We have determined that this turnover occurs at the flagellar tips, and that the assembly portion of the turnover is mediated by intraflagellar transport (IFT). Blocking IFT inhibits the incorporation of tubulin at the flagellar tips and causes the flagella to resorb. These results lead to a simple steady-state model for flagellar length regulation by which a balance of assembly and disassembly can effectively regulate flagellar length.},

A mutually exclusive centriole/basal body existence during cell-cycle progression has become a widely accepted principle. Contrary to this view, we show here that cilia assemble and persist through two meiotic divisions in Drosophila spermatocytes. Remarkably, all four centrioles assemble primary cilia-centriole complexes that transit from the plasma membrane encased in a packet of membrane, recruit centrosomal material into microtubule-organizing centers, and persist at the spindle poles through division. Thus, spermatocyte centrioles organize centrosomes and cilia simultaneously at cell division. These findings challenge the prevailing view that cilia antagonize cell-cycle progression and raise the possibility that cilium retention at cell division may occur in diverse organisms and cell types.},

IFT functions as a protein carrier delivering hundreds of distinct proteins into growing cilia. IFT-based protein import and export continue in fully grown cilia and are required for ciliary maintenance and sensing. Large ciliary building blocks might depend on IFT to move through the transition zone, which functions as a ciliary gate. Smaller, freely diffusing proteins, such as tubulin, depend on IFT to be concentrated or removed from cilia.

  abstract = {The transition zone (TZ) of primary cilia serves as a diffusion barrier to regulate ciliogenesis and receptor localization for key signaling events such as sonic hedgehog signaling. Its gating mechanism is poorly understood due to the tiny volume accommodating a large number of ciliopathy-associated molecules. Here we performed stimulated emission depletion (STED) imaging of collective samples and recreated superresolved relative localizations of eight representative species of ciliary proteins using position averages and overlapped with representative electron microscopy (EM) images, defining an architectural foundation at the ciliary base. Upon this framework, transmembrane proteins TMEM67 and TCTN2 were accumulated at the same axial level as MKS1 and RPGRIP1L, suggesting that their regulation roles for tissue-specific ciliogenesis occur at a specific level of the TZ. CEP290 is surprisingly localized at a different axial level bridging the basal body (BB) and other TZ proteins. Upon this molecular architecture, two reservoirs of intraflagellar transport (IFT) particles, correlating with phases of ciliary growth, are present: one colocalized with the transition fibers (TFs) while the other situated beyond the distal edge of the TZ. Together, our results reveal an unprecedented structural framework of the TZ, facilitating our understanding in molecular screening and assembly at the ciliary base.},

  abstract = {The life cycle of a primary cilium begins in quiescence and ends prior to mitosis. In quiescent cells, the primary cilium insulates itself from contiguous dynamic membrane processes on the cell surface to function as a stable signaling apparatus. Here, we demonstrate that basal restriction of ciliary structure dynamics is established by the cilia-enriched phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase, Inpp5e. Growth induction displaces ciliary Inpp5e and accumulates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in distal cilia. This change triggers otherwise-forbidden actin polymerization in primary cilia, which excises cilia tips in a process we call cilia decapitation. While cilia disassembly is traditionally thought to occur solely through resorption, we show that an acute loss of IFT-B through cilia decapitation precedes resorption. Finally, we propose that cilia decapitation induces mitogenic signaling and constitutes a molecular link between the cilia life cycle and cell-division cycle. This newly defined ciliary mechanism may find significance in cell proliferation control during normal development and cancer.},

  abstract = {Cilia are essential to many diverse cellular processes. Although many major axonemal components have been identified and studied, how they interact to form a functional axoneme is not completely understood. To further our understanding of the protein composition of human airway cilia, we performed a semiquantitative analysis of ciliary axonemes using label-free LC/MSE, which identified over 400 proteins with high confidence. Tubulins were the most abundant proteins identified, with evidence of 20 different isoforms obtained. Twelve different isoforms of axonemal dynein heavy chain were also identified. Absolute quantification of the nontubulin components demonstrated a greater than 75-fold range of protein abundance (RSPH9;1850 fmol vs CCDC103;24 fmol), adding another level of complexity to axonemal structure. Of the identified proteins, approximately 70% are known axonemal proteins. In addition, many previously uncharacterized proteins were identified. Unexpectedly, several of these, including ERICH3, C1orf87, and CCDC181, were present at high relative abundance in the cilia. RT-PCR analysis and immunoblotting confirmed cilia-specific expression for eight uncharacterized proteins, and fluorescence microscopy demonstrated unique axonemal localizations. These studies have provided the first quantitative analysis of the ciliary proteome and have identified and characterized several previously unknown proteins as major constituents of human airway cilia.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Skeletal ciliopathies comprise a spectrum of ciliary malfunction disorders that have a profound effect on the skeleton. Most common among these disorders is short rib polydactyly syndrome (SRPS), a recessively inherited perinatal lethal condition characterized by a long narrow chest, markedly shortened long bones, polydactyly and, often, multi-organ system involvement. SRPS shows extensive locus heterogeneity with mutations in genes encoding proteins that participate in cilia formation and/or function. RESULTS: Herein we describe mutations in IFT43, a satellite member of the retrograde IFT-A complex, that produce a form of SRPS with unusual bending of the ribs and appendicular bones. These newly described IFT43 mutations disrupted cilia formation, produced abnormalities in cartilage growth plate architecture thus contributing to altered endochondral ossification. We further show that the IFT43 SRPS phenotype is similar to SRPS resulting from mutations in the gene encoding IFT121 (WDR35), a direct interactor with IFT43. CONCLUSIONS: This study defines a new IFT43-associated phenotype, identifying an additional locus for SRPS. The data demonstrate that IFT43 is essential for ciliogenesis and that the mutations disrupted the orderly proliferation and differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes, resulting in a severe effect on endochondral ossification and mineralization. Phenotypic similarities with SRPS cases resulting from mutations in the gene encoding the IFT43 direct interacting protein IFT121 suggests that similar mechanisms may be disrupted by defects in these two IFT-A satellite interactors.

  abstract = {Intraflagellar transport (IFT) is a conserved mechanism essential for the assembly and maintenance of most eukaryotic cilia and flagella. However, IFT25, a component of the IFT complex is not required for the formation of cilia in somatic tissues. In mice, the gene is highly expressed in the testis, and its expression is up-regulated during the final phase when sperm flagella are formed. To investigate the role of IFT25 in sperm flagella formation, the gene was specifically disrupted in male germ cells. All homozygous knockout mice survived to adulthood and did not show any gross abnormalities. However, all homozygous knockout males were completely infertile. Sperm numbers were reduced and these sperm were completely immotile. Multiple morphological abnormalities were observed in sperm, including round heads, short and bent tails, with some tails showing branched flagella and others with frequent abnormal thicknesses, as well as swollen tips of the tail. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that flagellar accessory structures, including the fibrous sheath and outer dense fibers, were disorganized, and most sperm had also lost the "9+2" microtubule structure. In the testis, IFT25 forms a complex with other IFT proteins. In Ift25 knockout testes, IFT27, an IFT25 binding partner, was missing, and IFT20 and IFT81 levels were also reduced. Our findings suggest that IFT25, although not necessary for the formation of cilia in somatic cells, is indispensable for sperm flagellum formation and male fertility in mice.},

  abstract = {Intraflagellar transport (IFT) is required for ciliogenesis by ferrying ciliary components using IFT complexes as cargo adaptors. IFT54 is a component of the IFT-B complex and is also associated with cytoplasmic microtubules (MTs). Loss of IFT54 impairs cilia assembly as well as cytoplasmic MT dynamics. The N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain of IFT54 interacts with tubulins/MTs and has been proposed to transport tubulin during ciliogenesis, whereas the C-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain binds IFT20. However, the precise function of these domains in vivo is not well understood. We showed that in Chlamydomonas, loss of IFT54 completely blocks ciliogenesis but does not affect spindle formation and proper cell cycle progression, even though IFT54 interacts with mitotic MTs. Interestingly, IFT54 lacking the CH domain allows proper flagellar assembly. The CH domain is required for the association of IFT54 with the axoneme but not with mitotic MTs, and also regulates the flagellar import of IFT54 but not IFT81 and IFT46. The C-terminal CC domain is essential for IFT54 to bind IFT20, and for its recruitment to the basal body and incorporation into IFT complexes. Complete loss of IFT54 or the CC domain destabilizes IFT20. ift54 mutant cells expressing the CC domain alone rescue the stability of IFT20 and form stunted flagella with accumulation of both IFT-A component IFT43 and IFT-B component IFT46, indicating that IFT54 also functions in IFT turn-around at the flagellar tip.},

The stereotyped structure and signaling function of cilia inextricably depend on the selective segregation of molecules in cilia. However, the fundamental principles governing the access of soluble proteins to primary cilia remain unresolved. We developed a methodology termed 'chemically inducible diffusion trap at cilia' to visualize the diffusion process of a series of fluorescent proteins ranging in size from 3.2 nm to 7.9 nm into primary cilia. We found that the interior of the cilium was accessible to proteins as large as 7.9 nm. The kinetics of ciliary accumulation of this panel of proteins was exponentially limited by their Stokes radii. Quantitative modeling suggests that the diffusion barrier operates as a molecular sieve at the base of cilia. Our study presents a set of powerful, generally applicable tools for the quantitative monitoring of ciliary protein diffusion under both physiological and pathological conditions.},

  abstract = {Cilia are microtubule based organelles and perform motile, sensing and signaling functions. The assembly and maintenance of cilia depend on intraflagellar transport. Besides ciliary localization, most IFT proteins accumulate at basal bodies. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of basal body targeting of IFT proteins. We first identified the possible basal body targeting sequence of IFT46 by expressing IFT46 truncations in ift46-1 mutant. The C-terminal sequence 246-321 aa, termed BBTS3, was sufficient to target YFPs to basal bodies in ift46-1 Interestingly, BBTS3 is also responsible for the ciliary targeting of IFT46. BBTS3::YFP moves bidirectionally in flagella and interacts with other IFT-B proteins. Using IFT and motor mutants, we show that the basal body localization of IFT46 depends on IFT52, but not on IFT81, IFT88, IFT122, FLA10 or DHC1b. IFT52 interacts with IFT46 through L285/L286 of IFT46 and recruits it to basal bodies. Ectopic expression of IFT52C in the nucleus resulted in accumulation of IFT46 in nuclei. These data suggest IFT52 and IFT46 can preassemble as a complex in the cytoplasm, which is then targeted to basal bodies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The unicellular green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, is a classic model for studying flagella and biofuel. However, precise gene editing, such as Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein (Cas9) system, is not widely used in this organism. Screening of random insertional mutant libraries by polymerase chain reaction provides an alternate strategy to obtain null mutants of individual gene. But building, screening, and maintaining such a library was time-consuming and expensive. RESULTS: By selecting a suitable parental strain, keeping individual mutants using the agar plate, and designing an insertion cassette-specific primer for library screening, we successfully generated and maintained ~150,000 insertional mutants of Chlamydomonas, which was used for both reverse and forward genetics analysis. We obtained 26 individual mutants corresponding to 20 genes and identified 967 motility-defect mutants including 10 mutants with defective accumulation of intraflagellar transport complex at the basal body. We also obtained 929 mutants defective in oil droplet assembly after nitrogen deprivation. Furthermore, a new insertion cassette with splicing donor sequences at both ends was also constructed, which increased the efficiency of gene interruption. CONCLUSION: In summary, this library provides a multifunctional platform both for obtaining mutants of interested genes and for screening of mutants with specific phenotype.},

  abstract = {Cytoplasmic dynein-2 powers retrograde intraflagellar transport that is essential for cilium formation and maintenance. Inactivation of dynein-2 by mutations in DYNC2H1 causes skeletal dysplasias, and it remains unclear how the dynein-2 heavy chain moves in cilia. Here, using the genome-editing technique to produce fluorescent dynein-2 heavy chain in Caenorhabditis elegans, we show by high-resolution live microscopy that dynein-2 moves in a surprising way along distinct ciliary domains. Dynein-2 shows triphasic movement in the retrograde direction: dynein-2 accelerates in the ciliary distal region and then moves at maximum velocity and finally decelerates adjacent to the base, which may represent a physical obstacle due to transition zone barriers. By knocking the conserved ciliopathy-related mutations into the C. elegans dynein-2 heavy chain, we find that these mutations reduce its transport speed and frequency. Disruption of the dynein-2 tail domain, light intermediate chain, or intraflagellar transport (IFT)-B complex abolishes dynein-2's ciliary localization, revealing their important roles in ciliary entry of dynein-2. Furthermore, our affinity purification and genetic analyses show that IFT-A subunits IFT-139 and IFT-43 function redundantly to promote dynein-2 motility. These results reveal the molecular regulation of dynein-2 movement in sensory cilia.},
